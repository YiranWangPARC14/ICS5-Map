<p>The pollution of waters in Cameroon is concentrated near the city area where lagoon waters, loaded with sewage, are currently used by people in the city. This results in harmful pollution in the water. Such pollution may become a real health risk for humans who make use of the waters of Cameroon and aquatic life that inhibits in them.
</p><p>The Douala Lagoon basically functions as Cameroon&#39;s waste disposal. A study shows a high mortality rate for the organisms inhibiting the lagoon; these results were attributed to food and chemical discharges (Akoachere, Oben, Mbivnjo, Ndip, Nkwelang, and Ndip 85-89). These findings of contamination suggested the presence of vile pathogens which would endanger the health of not only aquatic life, but humans.
</p><p>Thereafter, an 8 month study took place in order to find more information on these pathogens and the health risks they posed for local residents (Akoachere, Oben, Mbivnjo, Ndip, Nkwelang, and Ndip 85-89). Samples of water were taken from five locations and 11 different pathogens were found in the waters of the lagoon. Based on the findings of these studies, the pollution in the Doula lagoon presents a serious health risk to organisms that make use of these waters. Perhaps if residents of the Doula Municipality were aware of the risk factors, granted waste disposal facilities and the industries turned to proper disposal of their waste, those who make use of the Doula lagoon would run less health risks (Akoachere, Oben, Mbivnjo, Ndip, Nkwelang, and Ndip 85-89).
</p><p>Cameroon&#39;s natural resources are consistently exploited, resulting in land deterioration. Land deterioration along with rapid environmental change may lead to inundation, flooding and risks of sea level rise (Greenland). Metropolitan Douala is home to 458,426 people and the population continues to grow at a rate of eight percent. Over population definitely contributes to land deterioration; land is exploited to begin with and a larger population will demand more resources, resulting in a worse quality of soil. Land deterioration has amounted to a greater problem, scarcity of land. The Doula lagoon itself is a result of land deterioration given that it was formed by tidal movements, floods and storms which higher the probability of future degradation (Greenland). Tidal movements not only inundate and flood the area but spreads mud flats, salt marshes, wetlands and mangroves. Whether Cameroon&#39;s issue is seen as scarcity of land or plentiful aquatic terrain, this issue hinders the growth of any urban growth in the area. The coastal zone of the Doula lagoon are so  deteriorated that in order to keep harbor facilities up and running, sand must be replenished around the harbor (sand dredging). Both the quality of the land as well as the rapidly growing population contribute to these terrible conditions.
</p><p>Cameroon forests contain about 300 different species of trees which are sold overseas and provide plenty of jobs in the process (Awung). Primitive populations inhibit in the forests of Cameroon and deforestation puts their lives at risk. Crop cultivation is one of the primary causes for deforestation (Awung). Given that Cameroon&#39;s economy is based on crop cultivation, the most effective way to reduce deforestation is by developing more sustainable yet efficient methods for the people of Cameroon. Studies confirm that there is a high rate of forest clearing in Cameroon that requires urgent attention (Gbetnkom). Cash, food crop prices, timber process are the motivation behind the profitability of farming and logging activities that cause deforestation. Many people aware of the effects of deforestation demand the establishment of policies which will either make deforestation less profitable or alternatives, like conserving forests, more profitable. Many have suggested changing the nature and locations of roads built, restricting some of the most destructive operators in the logging industry and the reduction of logging in inappropriate areas. Changing economic conditions (oil boom, structural adjustment policies, and the devaluation of the CFA franc) are causes and have ultimately sped up the process of deforestation in the lands of Cameroon (Gbetnkom). It would be senseless to suggest that activities that result in deforestation come to a complete stop but with proper methods and realistic alternatives the rate of deforestation in Cameroon can be controlled to an extent. 
</p><p>Many solutions have been proposed in response to deforestation. One of the most realistic proposals is &#34;selective logging&#34; in which people are more conservative in regards to the amount of trees they actually cut down. But then the question, &#34;which trees should I cut down and which ones should I leave standing?&#34; rises. &#34;CLASlite (Carnegie Landsat Analysis System) algorithms use calibration, atmospheric correction, cloud-masking, and spectral signal processes with carious satellite sensors&#34; to map forest areas and detect deforestation (Salisbury). This system utilizes aerial photography and computer models in order to function properly (Salisbury). Degradation areas are represented through accurate red and blue on the forest cover. A major benefit is that CLASlite algorithms do not require expertise for operation.
</p><p>A second option would be to make use of AToMS (Airborne Taxonomic Mapping System) which performs the same task as CLASlite algorithms yet requires expertise to operate the system, map and ultimately distinguish what parts of a certain forest are undergoing deforestation (Salisbury). For both methods, LiDAR software and methods disclose biochemical properties of individual trees if one needs that precise information. The great advantage of these methods is that one can precisely analyze where vegetation subsists in a precise and sufficient way (Salisbury). If someone or a group of people were to take the first step towards selective logging, this innovation in information technology would assure that they preserve areas where deforestation has struck the most. Once given this information, the people of Cameroon may become more aware of how intensifying deforestation has impacted their country. Furthermore, those in charge of selective logging would only cut down trees located in areas where there seems to be less deforestation.
</p><p>Although these systems may be able to enhance the process of selective logging, there are some technical limitations that can hinder this process. In order to track what parts of land are undergoing deforestation, one would have to maintain accurate mapping software. If selective logging was an adopted practice in many parts of Cameroon then people without expertise would need to have access to the previously mentioned systems and software. Distribution and applicability of these systems would then be more common but would need to be compatible with average computers or laptops (Salisbury). These are simply concerns that would have to be taken into account if these solutions were to be enforced. Although not much is done for deforestation or many environmental issues occurring in Cameroon, the use of CLASlite, AToMS, or similar systems would definitely help improve the environmental issues in Cameroon.
</p><p>In my perspective, water pollution is the most detrimental and important environmental issue in Cameroon due to the fact that the pollution of the Doula lagoon is directly harming the inhabitants&#39; health. Other environmental issues may harm their health at a slower rate which I would consider less important. The second most important issue is land deterioration because, although it does not harm inhabitants directly, it does not allow them to grow crops and ultimately have a more prosperous economy or higher quality of life. Deforestation is the least important environmental issue since it will not cause as much damage as the first two issues. If it does have a greater impact on the people of Cameroon, it will probably be in the long run and not immediately. The last issue can probably wait until the first two are resolved since it does not appear to be as stressed for time as the previous two issues.</p>
