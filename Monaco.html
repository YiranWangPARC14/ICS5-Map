	Technology has brought about a vast amount of significant changes to the
planet and everyone who lives on it. Although there is no disputing that it has 
had a positive influence in the world, there is also a downside that has become more 
and more evident with the its growth. As of late, the world has become more aware 
than ever before of the damage it has been doing to the planet. From world leaders to 
high school teachers, everyone is beginning to understand that the Earth’s finite 
amount of resources will not be able to sustain an infinitely growing population. 
The initial country that I researched was Monaco. However, because Monaco is the 
second smallest country in the world, one of the wealthiest, and a tourist attraction
I couldn’t find any outstanding environmental issues that are affecting it. As a 
result, I turned my attention to its surrounding countries, France and Italy, because 
their environmental issues will undoubtedly affect Monaco. While first half of this essay 
will focus on the top three environmental issues in the order of most to least 
important; air pollution in Italy, waste management in Italy, and climate change in 
France respectively, the second half will concentrate on the air pollution detection 
system that Monaco has implemented in their country to combat carbon dioxide emissions. 
	The most alarming environmental issue is the extent of air pollution in Italy. 
Pollution is measured by PM10 or atmospheric particles that are less than 10 millionth 
of a meter. According to the World Health Organization Italy’s levels of pollution ranged 
from 26.3 to 61.1 mg/m3 in 2002 to 2004 and they consistently go over the limit of days the 
air pollution is allowed to be above PM10. The main causes of air pollution are broken down into 
four sections. The first and main cause is transport. The people of Italy constantly use their 
cars and it adds up to a total of 65 percent of the total nitrogen oxide emissions. In 2011, the 
air quality of Rome was so bad that officials had to close the city to cars that weren’t hybrids 
or electric for two days. Following that incident, cars that had an even number on the 
license plate were allowed to go into the city on some days while cars that had an odd 
number on the license plate were allowed to go into the city on the others. The second 
cause is the manufacturing industry. The pollution that the overwhelming smoke stacks 
cause makes up fifteen percent of the emissions. Furthermore, Italy is reliant on these 
industries because they make up around ten billion dollars of their economy. The third cause 
is the production of energy which makes up eleven percent of the emissions. Finally, the 
last nine percent of pollution is caused by the residential sectors. Due to various types 
of emissions, air pollution is the leading environmental hazard in Italy.
	The second most important issue that will be addressed is the lack of waste management 
in Italy. One of the negative aspects that Italy is known for is the amount of trash that is on 
its streets. The prime example is the city of Naples, which has had a growing waste management 
problem for years, and had its climax in 2008. In 2011, the Italian Army was dispatched to clean 
up two-thousand tons of garbage from the streets of Naples and seven-hundred forty thousand tons 
of garbage from Terzigno. The landfill that is on the streets has two main origins. These origins 
include the corporations and the mafia that facilities illegal dumping. Illegal dumping also leads 
to illegal waste burning. The provinces of Naples, mainly, Qualiano, Giugliano and Villaricca, 
has felt the affects the most. The residents of the area have had to live with never ending 
toxic fumes that was a result of the burnings. Data shows that of the thirty- nine landfills 
in Naples, twenty-seven are filled with toxic waste. Although Italy is setting up regulations to try 
and combat the situation, waste management continues to be a huge factor in their country.
	Lastly, the final environmental issue is the climate change in France. In the twentieth 
century, France has seen an average gross of .9 degrees Celsius. The increase in temperature has 
had profound effects on the landscape, agriculture, and biodiversity of France. For example, 
the snow on the Alps has continuously begun to melt faster and that leads to a migration of the plants. 
Furthermore, the species of fish change in rivers due to the increasing temperatures; fish that are 
able to live in warmer water survive and take over the rivers while fish that can only live in colder 
waters die off. Also, with the weather becoming hotter, the chance of drought is more likely. And if 
a drought occurs, it will undoubtedly affect the agriculture of France. Climate change, if left unchecked, 
will cause a great deal of damage to not only France but the world.
	The method that was used to determine the order of importance for these three 
environmental issues was how directly each of them affected the people. Air pollution is considered 
most important because has led to many deaths and continues to plague Italy by infecting its inhabitants 
with diseases such as lung cancer. Waste management was seen as second most important because although 
it isn’t associated with a mortality rate, the sheer amount of waste that Italy is compiling is unsanitary 
to say the least. The toxics that originate from dumping will cause casualties both in biodiversity and 
in the health of human beings. Finally, climate change was considered the least important because it 
doesn’t have an immediate negative affect such as air pollution or waste management does. It 
is considered more of a long term environmental issue that must be dealt with. Furthermore, climate change, 
isn’t something that can be fixed if only France decided to go green; all of the countries would have to “go green” 
in order for people to see a substantial difference.
	As air pollution becomes more and more evident in the world, technology must advance to combat it. 
Information technology is a large field that can give humans the tools necessary to take on the daunting 
task of lowering air pollution while maintaining certain lifestyles. A prime example of such technology 
is the wireless air pollution monitoring system or “WAPMS.” The basis of this idea is simple. Place small, 
wireless, self-sustaining sensor nodes into an environment, have them collect data about the quality of the 
air, and return the results to a centralized server where scientists can analyze the data and observe 
whether or not a specific location is over polluted. 
	The execution of putting this type of operation into place is difficult due to the various aspects 
that need to be accounted for. Firstly, a server must be developed that can autonomously tell the nodes to 
collect information and report back. Secondly, these nodes will have to have an ample amount of power 
supply so that they don’t malfunction when transferring large amounts of data. Thirdly, a method of which 
to easily understand the levels of air pollution must be developed such as a spectrum of colors, each color 
representing a range of toxicity in the air. Finally, thousands of these nodes must be developed in order 
to receive a consistent amount of data. However, once this system is incorporated into a specific region 
it becomes a valuable asset that makes the work of scientists much easier. There are a number of benefits 
that come into play once the system is in place. Scientists will be able to analyze data on both a day to 
day basis and compare average air pollution levels between months and years. Also, they will be able to 
see which regions have the most pollution and quickly take action to lower the levels in that area. 
Monaco has successfully developed an air pollution monitoring system and uses it daily.
	There are six air quality monitoring stations spread throughout Monaco. These stations are split 
into local monitoring stations and background stations. Local monitoring stations are located close 
to highways where pollution is evident. Background monitoring stations are placed far from the 
centralized pollution regions. The data that is returned from these stations are analyzed and published 
in the local newspaper daily so that anyone is able to access the information. This system allows for 
Monaco’s air quality to be superb. 
	These environmental issues are just a few of the many that must be overcome. Although Monaco can 
be considered a forerunner in “green” countries, there are still countless others that have not adapted. 
Those countries need to understand that if we continue the course of burning fossil fuels, polluting the earth, 
and using resources with constraint, future generations will have to live on a dying planet filled with smog 
and toxins. Making our planet more green must be a venture that every country is invested in.
