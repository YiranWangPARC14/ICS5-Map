Environmental Issues in Lebanon
<BR>
Located beside the Mediterranean Sea in the Middle East, for the past couple of decades, the country of Lebanon depended on the very limited resource of water.  Due to past cultural influences as well as conflicts with the neighboring countries, a breakout of wars resulted from the tumultuous region, one of which was the July War of 2006. The relationship between Lebanon and the bordering countries plays a crucial role towards the cause and effect of environmental issues concerning water resources, air pollution, and climate change. These three current environmental issues all affect one another; climate change, caused by the emission of carbon dioxide from factories and vehicles, explains the sudden rise of sea level that leads to flooding and “…close[s] off previous viable economic activities such as the export of water intensive crops” (LEBANON: Top give environmental threats). In addition, the change of climate increases water demand, which drastically lowers the availability of the already scarce resource of drinkable water. As a result, the multiple environmental threats that Lebanon faces, leads to a negative impact on the health and diet of the citizens in the country. Although the nation itself faces multiple environmental issues, by focusing on the investment of informational technology to control and regulate the air pollution, Lebanon will be able to solve its current predicament.

Making up nearly seventy percent of one’s body composition, water is considered the most important human need.  Therefore, the most important environmental concern in Lebanon today is the scarcity and pollution of the available water resources. The scarcity of clean water, specifically in the Middle East, forces many countries to compete against each other for the limited resource.  The water in the Middle East is constantly being polluted by daily human activities, such as dumping trash and toxic chemicals in the Mediterranean Sea , “the [only] available water resources consist of renewable groundwater resources and surface water resources…” (Haddadin). Additionally, the demographic of where Lebanon is located does not provide additional reserves of water because most of the countries in the region have limited water resources as well. The shared body of water consequently places all borderline countries in conflict. Take the water war between Israel and Lebanon for example; “the convergence of a regional drought, history of violent confrontations between the two… distrust, varying development needs and territorial disputes almost culminated in a war between these east Mediterranean neighbors” (Amery). In addition to territorial challenges, there still remains the an impending problem: growth of the population and the migration of other racial individuals. Thus illustrates the direct proportion of an additional individual reduce the available water supply and generate excessive pollutants.

The second most important environmental issue in Lebanon is the emission of different toxic and chemical gasses, causing air pollution. A series of study and reports have shown that the capital of Lebanon, Beirut, has been constantly exposed to high levels of air pollution during the recent years. The concern for this issue is that “air pollution is a major environmental risk factor for poor health and causes about 2 million premature deaths…” (Wadvalla). Furthermore, the measurements of the chemicals in the air above the East Mediterranean cities “[is] higher than most emission measurements reported from the West Mediterranean cities” (Shaka). The study of the report compiled by Shaka points to the capital of Lebanon, Beirut, which is also located amongst the Eastern Mediterranean cities. It is no surprise that living in a closely condensed city with a population exceeding the safe maximum capacity is releasing a tremendous amount of harmful air pollutant. Tracing back to its origin, the nation’s citizens and factories are the ones to blame. The increase in factories and growth of human population would only stimulate and produce more and more toxic gasses; from burning fossil fuels to company productions.

Last but not least, in response to the amount of chemical and gas released into the atmosphere, the temperature begins to change drastically year after year. Global warming is the perfect direct result of a climate change. As the global temperature gradually rises, icebergs began to melt which then leads to the rise of the sea level, which changes the balance of the current eco structure.  Additionally, many scientists have been speculating that the “…oceans and clouds will [act accordingly] to the [un]expected warming …and the variations in climate may mitigate many of the expected changes” (Lonergan). On the other hand, humans would be experiencing an uncomfortable hot weather, and also a reduction in the supply of water through evaporation. As mentioned by Lonergan and Kavanagh, “ [the] surface water availability and use are not readily accessible for the Middle East, [because] of the change in evaporation due to climate warming were made to illustrate the potential impact on water availability” (Lonergan). Ultimately, the release of greenhouse gasses not only makes a huge undesirable impact on the environment in terms of sustainability and biodiversity in Lebanon, but also generates several challenges within the country, which includes the shortage of fresh and available water as well as an unanticipated rise in temperature.

By implementing the control of information technology, the government should be able to regulate and propose policies to stop the existing harmful environmental issues and start protecting the health of the citizens. Since Lebanon is a moderately developed nation with institutions and industrialization, it will not be difficult to design a system that regulates the amount of toxic chemicals and industrial waste generated. Furthermore, to promote efficiency in production and limit the amount of resources used, the factories could still produce the same amount of products by monitoring via information technology. Lebanon needs a quick solution to the pollution problem, and information technology is the fastest and most efficient method in solving this dilemma. For instance, the Australian water company, South East Water, installed smart water meters which monitors daily water consumption. This reduces the amount of water consumed because it reminds the consumers how much water they are using and accurately bill them for excess use. In fostering information technology in Lebanon, through precise monitoring systems and projection models, it would guarantee to make the environment a greener place as long as the action to control the pollutants is taken. At the same time, the government should consider to invest in more infrastructures, and to utilize them not only in the short-run, which is to stop the pollution, as well as the long-run, which pertains to the efficiency of using the scarce resources around Lebanon.

The examination of the three important environmental challenges evidently illustrates the relationship among the three issues that they are simply a chain of events. It could also be explained as the “domino effect,” in which a chain reaction occurs when an environmental issue causes a relatable change of another issue. The air pollution due to the release of greenhouse gasses leads to global climate change, thus, resulting in the sea level to rise and bodies of water to evaporate. With the help of the implementation of information technology, which plays a critical role in monitoring and controlling the issues being addressed, Lebanon could slowly but surely rebuild its biodiversity and environment by investing in the development of new technology to reduce the toxic chemicals and harmful pollutants that are being released.
