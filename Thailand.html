Thailand and its Environmental Issues<BR>

	<BR>Waste management has been an incredibly big environmental issue in Thailand, and it is not just the domestic waste that the citizens of Thailand produce. Chemical waste, to be specific, can be ingested via water or agriculture. It can be fatal and has been a regional problem in Thailand. The Ron Phibun district of southern Thailand has had a history of arsenic-contaminated drinking water, which is caused by the rivers carrying arsenic compounds into this area from mining sites around the Southeast Asian Tin Belt. It was discovered that several people developed skin cancer from drinking arsenic-laden water, so it was important that the government stepped in and tried to find a solution. It was then recommended by the Japanese government to remove the arsenic-filled soil and to have it transferred to a landfill, but with Thailand’s budget, it is not feasible. Instead, other measures have been recommended, such as the use of rainwater jars, pipeline water, sedimentation and filtration, and more. However, even these alternatives have their disadvantages, so the government must try to find an effective solution for chemical waste (Jones, et. al.).
	<BR>The next big environmental issue of Thailand is air pollution. Particulate matter air pollution has been detected in areas with power plants, and it has taken a negative toll on the respiratory systems of the people that live in areas with particulate matter in the air. With some careful planning, less people can suffer from weakened respiratory systems if power plants are built in less populated areas. This particular problem can be stopped from becoming a bigger issue if power plants were just planned and built carefully (Vichit-Vadaka, et. al.). However, Thailand’s more urban area such as Bangkok was studied for 5 years for the correlation between air pollution and mortality rates, and it was discovered that even vehicle emissions in urban areas with traffic congestion have contributed to deaths. It was discovered also that children are more susceptible to respiratory diseases and asthma. The study speculates that the reason for Thai people to be more exposed to air pollution is due to certain factors that are characteristic of the citizens of Thailand. Most of the population is usually stuck in traffic, the Thai people prefer air circulation with by opening their windows or doors as opposed to using an air conditioner, these people spend most of their hours outdoors (even to eat), and exposure to incense and cooking. All of these are distinct, as Thai people were found to be involved in these factors more than people from other countries (Vichit-Vadaka). A possible way for the government to alleviate air pollution in Thailand is by controlling the vehicle emissions, and getting the public educated on exactly how dangerous air pollution is and the impact it has on everyone’s lives. With the public having an idea of how bad air pollution is, perhaps the citizens of Thailand will go out of their way to reduce vehicle emissions by carpooling, using more bikes, or taking more public transportation.  
<BR>Another one of Thailand’s most pressing environmental issues is the country’s groundwater pollution. The factors that contribute to the problem of Thailand’s groundwater pollution are the increasing number of people living in Thailand, “economical, agricultural, and industrial effluents and domestic sewage,” cause groundwater pollution in this country (State of Water: Thailand). Pesticides used in agriculture have found their way into groundwater, chemical wastes such as arsenic have been disposed of by big companies (or by mining) have also reached local waters that are consumed by villagers, and inadequate sewage systems have also contributed to the contamination of groundwater in Thailand. 
<BR>The environmental issues were described in the above order by the extremity in lack of a concrete solution. The first issue of chemical waste is the most important, because there hasn’t been an effective method of removing chemicals away from human consumption. Methods have been proposed, but these methods all have disadvantages that may backfire on some aspect of Thai life. I believe that the issue of chemical waste management is extremely important and should be researched in order to find a viable solution, in order to prevent diseases such as skin cancer. Air pollution was the next big issue, because there are ways to prevent it with viable solutions that have been proposed. However, it is largely up to how the Thai people go about their lives inside of their homes or outside on the road that ultimately contributes to air pollution. Groundwater pollution was next, as it is the problem that has the most concrete plan in order for the problem to diminish. Information technologies are available to help researchers understand the conditions of groundwater in particular areas, and for the government to pay more attention to areas that need it the most. The next section describes how information technology is used for this particular issue and how further technologies could be developed to alleviate the problem of groundwater pollution.
	<BR>The issue of groundwater pollution is related to an information technology, as it is possible to use a geographic information systems technology in order to develop maps that can aid in determining which groundwater areas of Thailand are susceptible to contamination. As the study by Anat Thapinta and Paul F. Hudak demonstrates, geographic information systems can map areas and produce visuals on how the factors of groundwater pollution apply to each area. First of all, data would have to be collected from a particular area, with different factors of data taken into consideration in order to have a more accurate and hypothetical outcome. In the study by Thapinta and Hudak, information about soil, slope, land use, well depth, rainfall, and observed pesticide concentrations in groundwater were collected in order to help calculate which areas were the most. After data is collected, the information can be inputted into technologies such as ArcView or ArcInfo in order to have a visual on how the particular area looks according to the data for the factors that were researched (Thapinta, Hudak).
<BR>As mentioned earlier, groundwater pollution is a serious environmental issue, since it can affect people directly. According to the report by Thapinta and Hudak, those that reside in agricultural areas or collect water from a shallow well are also more exposed to harmful contaminants, (in terms of groundwater) due to the state of the sediment, with unconsolidated being better than consolidated sediments. (Unconsolidated sediments are made of gravel, sand, clay, and other relatively soft sediments, while consolidated sediments are made of harder sediments.) The government should take care to make sure that these areas are particularly safe from groundwater pollution. If the water consumed by workers and farmers in the agricultural industry and the water used to grow food for a population of Thailand were contaminated, it would directly affect people that produce food by making them sick, and everyone else that consumes food from this area would be affected due to the lack of such food that the sick workers cannot produce. They could also be affected because certain pesticides used to grow food and contaminants from groundwater could spread sickness to those that consume the contaminated produce. 
<BR>The use of a geographic information systems technology would help to monitor the areas that are most susceptible, as there are financial and duration limitations to having monitoring systems in as many areas as possible. This technology is efficient in determining where the problems are most urgent, so it is a technology that not only Thailand but other countries with groundwater pollution would want to consider and implement in their country. The maps that the geographic information systems technology produced can be used for “groundwater protection planning, decision making, and management… Organisations that might be benefit from this… include the Department of Groundwater Resources, the Pollution Control Department, the Department of Industrial Work,” and more (Kwansiririkul, et. al.). It is also crucial that the government of Thailand receives this information so that it can start to develop another information technology that will directly monitor the areas that are most susceptible to groundwater pollution. As Thailand is not as well off as other developed countries, perhaps the best solution is for another country to develop such an information technology system. If developed properly, this system would deem manual data collecting unnecessary. Paired with the geographic information systems technology, this combination could save Thailand a good amount of money, time, and the overall quality of life for its people.
