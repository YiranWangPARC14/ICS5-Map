Environmental Issues of Mongolia
<BR><BR>
Mongolia is a beautifully landscaped country hidden between the crevice of Russia and China. It has an illustrious history dating all the way back to the 11th century, with the most notable founding father; Genghis Khan. Mongolia finally reached democracy in the late 20th century through what is known as the “1990 Democratic Revolution in Mongolia”. It has since switched to an open market economy from a centrally planned one. With modern technology making its way through Mongolia, many environmental issues are still being tackled by the Mongolian government. The top three major environmental issues in Mongolia are high vulnerability to natural disasters, environmental degradation, and pollution. With the help of new innovative information technology, Mongolia will soon succeed and accelerate towards being the new Asian IT leader (Southern Innovator).

The first major environmental issue is currently the country’s high vulnerability to natural disasters. We are speaking of over eight different types which include severe winter conditions (AKA dzuds), heavy snowfall, blizzards, strong dust storms, forest and steppe fires, droughts, desertification, floods, and earthquakes (NOFC). The most dangerous and destructive natural disaster Mongolia experiences are dzuds. A dzud is a slow natural disaster that not only devastates the animal husbandry livestock but also creates catastrophic damage to the pastures across the country. It is considered a multiple natural disasters conjoined which first starts off as a summer drought followed by a very heavy winter snow, winds, and lower-than-normal temperatures. This hurts pastures due to the droughts, without any water, there would be an inadequate pasture and production of hay. In return the devastating snowstorms blanket the hay production and fodder, further reducing livestock sustainability (World Bank). This disaster in 2010 had caused the loss of nearly a fifth of the nation’s livestock. Nearly nine thousand herders lost their entire livestock while several thousands of herder households lost a majority of their livestock (Mongolia HDR). Not only is Mongolia prone to weather related natural disasters, but it is also very prone to active seismic areas. The three largest cities in Mongolia are actually located in magnitude seven to eight seismic active areas. 80 percent of the total land area and 70 percent of the urban areas are located in earthquake-prone regions. In the past three to five years, there have been at least 15 earthquakes recorded in ten provinces (Relief Web). With so much to already take care of, it is surprising that the Mongolian government is still able to keep up a positive GDP growth ratio. It is definitely a challenge not only for the government but also the national society as half of the country, approximately 1.2 million people, are spread out over a territory size of over 600,000 square miles.

The next major environmental issue that Mongolia faces is environmental degradation. Mongolia faces a large amount of different types of degradation such as pasture, air, soil, water, forest, and even urban degradation. The future of Mongolia can be detrimental if attention is not targeted at these issues immediately. The emphasis will be built around preserving and in few cases, restoring and increasing availability, access and management of natural resources such as water bodies, forests, land, ensuring its use by future generations. There has been a significant decrease in land having proximity to water over a five year timeline and this decrease is close to 50% in actual terms (2000 - 1667.4 hectares of land with proximity to water now in 2005 967.6 hectares) and an increase in land affected by mining (31.3 square hectares in 2003 to 193.1 sq in 2005) (Mongolia World Vision). Currently the degradation of agricultural lands or grasslands is the main form of land degradation while forest and steppe fires and mining account for a much smaller share of all land degradation. Within Asia, Mongolia actually holds the most proportion of people living on degraded lands. Land degradation is occurring all over Mongolia, however, it is most severe in five provinces and these provinces all together account for nearly 60 percent of all land degraded in Mongolia (Mongolia HDR). Besides land degradation, forest degradation has been a severe problem as well. About five percent of forest area is degraded each year in Mongolia as well as forest area the size of Ulaanbaatar, the capital city, is lost in forest fires every year. With the added danger of climate change and increased periods of dry weather, there will be greater risks of forest fires in the near future. The impacts of forest degradation include direct loss of hunting and forest produce which at present supplements household food production, indirect losses due to drying up of water resources or loss of firewood and consequently having to spend a greater proportion of household income or time on securing energy to keep warm. Other losses also include reduction in biodiversity which can further threaten the health of pastures and loss of species and accumulated knowledge (Mongolia HDR). Mongolia must keep environmental degradation at the second of the list after natural disasters of mandatory issues to take care of immediately.

The last major environmental issue of Mongolia is pollution. Since its transition to democracy in 1990, real GDP per capita in Mongolia has more than doubled. With high consistency in human development, there is also a return in externalities. The problem here is the rise in air pollution damage which damages the potential and wealth of the nation (Mongolia HDR). Urban air quality has been deteriorating due to the increase of pollution from average household heating, power generation, industry, and transport. Poor air quality pose serious health risks, as indicated by the increased numbers in children with respiratory diseases. Only 30 percent of the population has access to adequate sanitation, which is causing widespread contamination of surface and groundwater, both in Ulaanbaatar and the secondary cities (World Bank). With over 1.2 million people living in the capital city of Mongolia, pollution is definitely not an issue that can be easily brushed off. In their wintery months, the air pollution in the city of Ulaanbaatar is particularly severe due to the natural constraints in the layout of the city, surrounded by mountains, and the meteorological conditions with low temperatures and low mixing heights for most part of the year, which limits the dispersion of pollutants and enhancing their ambient concentrations (Urban Emmisions). In 1990, there were only about 10,000 cars on the road until in 2005, this number shot up to almost 80,000 cars on the road. This number expects to continue growing exponentially as not only Ulaanbaatar but Mongolia industrializes and globalizes.

With the role of information technology in mind, we can make large leaps of differences in this troubled and booming economy. Currently the Remote Sensing Laboratory of Research Center for Geophysics in National University of Mongolia has created a plan for dealing with the major environmental issue of Mongolia, natural disasters. It has already been acted upon, with a strong and detailed presentation backing it up. It will have dzud and drought monitors, snow coverage and vegetation mapping, forest and steppe fire detection and monitoring as well as dust storm detection systems. They have utilized NDVIs to map curves of land use changes with statistics on climate data in the last decade. They are also using Landsat data to track glacier changes in the Western mountains which have been slowly melting. The usage of sattelites have also been put to use for the monitoring of forest and steppe fires; more than half of the country is considered a fire-risk zone and 98.5 percent of forests are classified as high fire risk areas (NOFC). The output of information technology in the natural disaster zone has been tremendously helpful with data in graphs, satellite images, remote sensors, models, frequency charts, Landsat images, and etc. If this keeps up and more advanced usage of IT is available then the first major environmental issue of Mongolia may be actually contained very soon!
