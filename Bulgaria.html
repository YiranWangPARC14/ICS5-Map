The top three environmental issues in order from most severe to less is air pollution, soil degradation, and water pollution.<BR>
<BR>
AIR POLLUTION<BR>
<BR>
I chose air pollution as the top issue because of the overwhelming statistics on the horrible air quality in Bulgaria. Not only does air pollution deplete the ozone layer and affect the environment, but it also affects our health. One environmental effect that seemed to affect the people of Bulgaria the most is air pollution.<BR> 
<BR>	

Bulgaria’s heavy air pollution is due to “energy; industry; household consumption; and, to a great extent, transport” (novinite).The Human Development Report released in 2011 states that the death rate from air quality is 437 deaths per million people. Bulgaria ranks one of the top most polluted countries in Europe, and only Armenia and Romania has a higher death rate caused by pollution than Bulgaria (euractive). Furthermore, the second largest city Plovdiv ranks top in the most polluted city of Europe followed by Sofia ranked fourth out of thirty of the most polluted cities (novinite).<BR> 
<BR>
SOIL DEGRADATION<BR>
<BR>

I chose soil degradation as the second issue because this had been a long going issue, starting from way back when Bulgaria was under communist control. Another reason is because the industry in Bulgaria is growing fast. Unless legislations are passed to protect the environment, industries would keep producing toxic waste that would destroy the environment.<BR>
<BR>	
As a post communist country, Bulgaria was left with “legacy of inefficient use of energy and raw materials, as well as outdated and highly polluting technologies” (ESI). East European countries that were formally under communist control imposed heavy emphasis on mass agricultural production and industrialization while showing no concern for the environmental impact. The amount of farmland grew from 5,672,000 hectares in 1960 to 6,206,000 hectares in 1980. As a country promoting mass agriculture, the amount of machinery and fertilizers increased significantly as farmland increased (eea). The heavy use of electrical power and chemicals resulted in soil degradation and air and water pollution.<BR> 
<BR>
	
Growing industries has also been a key factor in environmental pressures. The rate of industrial growth nearly doubled in  2007 with 14 percent compared to 7.8 percent in 2006. 
Furthermore, recent study shows that out of the 2.5 million metric tons of waste produced each year, 70% is from industrial waste.<BR>
<BR>
	
Another contributor to soil degradation is waste disposal. In 1997, Bulgaria had not yet met the EU standards for landfills, and although Bulgaria had work and safety regulations, most part of the country lacked environmental legislations. In the late 1990s, it was stated that 77% of the total amount of treated hazardous waste were thrown into landfills of private enterprises (investnet). These landfills can no longer sustain itself and is highly toxic (esi). Additionally, as of 2009, there was only one municipal waste processing plant and only 25 recycling plants, which is not enough to cover all the waste produced by the country. (investnet)<BR>
<BR>	
WATER POLLUTION<BR>
<BR>	
Water pollution is yet another major problem. First of all, Bulgaria does not have a satisfactory sewage system, many of them being old and out-of-date (most of Bulgaria’s water and sewage system was built between 1945 and 1980), and rural areas do not have enough access to a sewage system. Statistics show that 95% of Bulgaria’s towns have access to the sewage system as opposed to only 3.2% of villages actually having one. Furthermore, many of these sewage systems does not comply with the EU standards and Bulgaria has yet to build 400 wastewater treatment plants by 2014 (water world). Another study shows that 39% of Bulgaria’s waste water was left untreated and released into the environment, clearly indicating the need for additional, improved water treatment plants (esi). <BR>
<BR>	
Bulgaria’s waters are highly polluted, often times due to poor farming methods and poor waste water treatments. Even rural areas have found compounds such as arsenic and lead as well as, in some cases, aluminum and pesticides. Experts also found severe nitrate contamination, and this contamination are “characteristics of agricultural districts using shallow drinking water”. In regards to water treatment, 357 water supply systems have been found with e.coli bacteria. According to the Ministry of Environment and Water, 18 out of the 28 districts lack drinkable water. The contamination was so significant that in 2007, the EU banned four drinking water sources. (novinite)<BR>
<BR>	
I chose water pollution as the last issue because there has already been considerable improvements in the waste water management. For example, construction of waste water treatment plants resulted in an increase of treated water from sixty-two percent in 2000 to seventy-nine percent in 2004.<BR>
<BR>
TELEWORK<BR>
<BR>
Research shows that more than 80% of the air pollution is caused by transportation. From the process of building automobiles, to actually driving them on the road, tons of carbon dioxide and chemicals are released into the air. Most part of Bulgaria lacks modern transportation and old vehicles are not eco-friendly. It is not only the engine that causes so much pollution, but also the lack of effort to reduce heavy traffic in urban areas. Additionally, most cities in Bulgaria are small and lack public transport. Transportation such as subways and trams could reduce pollution and yet small cities have to rely more on buses and cars. (youthinkgreen) A solution to this environmental problem is Telework.<BR>
<Br>
	
According to the European Framework Agreement on Telework of 2002, telework is defined as “a form of…work, using information technology, in the context of an employment contract/relationship, where work…is carried out away from those premises on a regular basis” (slides share.net). Occupations that may use telework are professionals and management specialists such as accountants and architects, information technology specialists, field workers such as journalists and auditors, and clerical workers. One of the reasons why telework is growing is because it can be applied to so many fields of work.<BR> 
<BR>
	
In 2003, Bulgaria had only 5.5 percent of the total workforce using telework compared to the average of 13 percent in other European Coutnries. However, telework is a relatively new field and statistics show a growing number of workers using telework. Additionally, EU countries that joined the EU in 2004 shows an average of 5.4 percent of workers involved in telework and Bulgaria had a higher percentage than the average (Euro found).<BR> 
<BR>
		
Telework has so many benefits for workers such as providing more freedom to workers, increasing productivity, and better use of time, but another important benefit is to the environment. Using telework would reduce pollution and help the environment in so many ways. Here we will focus on how telework reduces air pollution.<BR> 
<BR>
	
First of all, telework reduces the number of cars on the road. Telework allows workers to work at home, away from their company or office, therefore eliminating the need to use automobiles to travel several miles to work. Also, more teleworkers mean fewer cars on the road, and this would reduce traffic. Data shows “if 33 million Americans worked from home, Gulf oil imports could be reduced by 24% to 48%, greenhouse gases by up to 67 million metric tons a year, and as much as 7.5 trillion gallons of gasoline each year, for a total of $110 million in savings a day” (telework exchange). Smart 2020 also states that teleporting “reduces the commuting care mileage traveled by telworkers by 48-77%.” Although these statistics do not apply to other countries, the ideas are the same; telework reduces greenhouse gas and other pollutants that are released into the air.<BR> 
<BR>
	
Secondly, telework reduces office space and cost. The reduction of thousands of workers from office results in a smaller office space. This means that there will be fewer space needed for heating or cooling and electricity, which will cut down the energy use. Smart 2020 shows that if “people worked from home…this could lead to energy savings of 20-50%.” Through telework, AT&T was able to save $30 million per year from reduced carbon footprint and other costs, showing how telework does indeed cut energy and cost. (Mack global)<BR>
<BR>	
Thirdly, telework reduces paper consumption and waste created from using papers. Electronic documents replace the need for papers. Less paper means less need for cutting down trees which would help reduce the carbon in the air and there would also be fewer waste that would contribute to pollution.<BR> 
<BR>	
The fourth benefit is somewhat similar to the automobile example but on a larger scale. Part of telework is videoconferencing, which allows for people to hold meetings online or over phone calls and reduces the need to meet in person. This in turn reduces the need for transportation, not just in terms of automobiles, but also transportation in terms of airplane. Smart 2020 states that videoconferencing would replace between 5 and 20 percent of global business travel.<BR>
<BR>	
Telework is a growing information technology that would definitely help the environment in reasons mentioned above. Telework would allow for less use of cars that would otherwise be polluting the air.
