<center>Argentina</center>
<p>Environmental issues are just not in one place but all around the world. We don't notice it because we are not aware of what's going around us or just rather not pay attention. Especially when living in an urban area than in a farmland. Environmental issues are a problem because it changes many things as in climate, health and unsanitary living it could harm citizens and cause great damage to earth. Argentina has three main environmental issues deforestation, air pollution and garbage disposal. These three issues harm Argentina and the people living in it. Many productions don't realize because they may not live there and also because they do it for the money which is more important than saving the environment.</p>
<p>Deforestation in Argentina has been going around since 1980 to expand the agricultural of soybeans. Cutting down forest doesn't just affect the climate but also it endangers species that are living there. Most of us are not aware that some species are important because they play a role in the cycle of living. Deforestation causes problem to less clean air and also climate change because of all the chemicals going into the air. As on that the trees usually absorb Carbon-Dioxide and releases clean oxygen which helps us because we won't inhale toxic air. Also because of deforestation it leads to pesticides because of all the trees being burned down and causes damage. Because of deforestation it leads to air pollution. Also with many citizens driving their vehicles trying to go to their destination all the polluted air that the car releases goes to the air. Argentina also has three adjacent thermal power plants that pollute the air. Air pollution is a major problem because it affects citizen's health which ends up leading to many lives taken away. Since the combination of the vehicles going around every day and every minute including the three power plants which is located in Buenos Aires created in 1974 and including deforestations there is less chance of Argentina getting clean air. Air pollution causes effect of water supply because since we don't have clean air and all the oil that is being used to take down the forest goes down to the water line of Argentina and it mixes the chemicals and water. This causes great health risk to people living there because they depend on water to survive and to be able to plant their food. With chemicals in the water it affects their planting because once the plant absorbs the water it will die of the cause of all the chemicals it has. Lastly with garbage disposal is another issue in Argentina. It is mentioned that 1.4 million tons of garbage was produced in 2004. And 1.8 million tons was produced in 2009. It is increasing because there is more population and more things people are disposing of. This leads to unsanitary living that may cause health risks and lead to deaths. Not only do people throw away food and paper but also computers, batteries, furniture, plastic which most may not be recyclable and nowhere to dispose of. This is not good because then what do we do with all the garbage that could not be disposed of and not causing harm to people living around there and also with earth. At first burning was a source of cleaning away of things that are not wanted but then all the smoke and the chemicals that it releases it's not good. So then another source would be throwing it away to space but it is not good because all the garbage could come right back down to earth and hit us which could harm us. </p>
<p>Information Technology is the use of computers or networks to store information needed. In garbage disposals there is a lot of paper that it is included. Paper is used every day all around the world imagine how many trees have been cut down and how much paper really has been used it would be billions. It is not good because there is no way of recycling it and making a good cause of it. Also because the more paper we use the more trees are being cut down. A good way to lessen the amount of paper being thrown away in the trash and being used would be using a computer, or lap-top.  This would help because we will not need the use of paper. All the things that we need to write down could be saved in a file used in a computer. A computer is considered an Information Technology because it stores things that you need. And it is beneficial to us to save a lot of waste. IT could be a lot of help also because we use paper for writing letters, making corrections in other people writing, to advertise and many more. We could avoid that because now we could send messages online and we could contact people by using computers. This could stop people writing letters and lessen the production of paper. Also with bank statement are used to show your amount and this uses a lot of paper because many people have banks and also because they often shop and it shows all the transactions that are being made which leads to more paper being consumed. Now they have a paper-free and all your statements would be online which is good because it saves many trees. And the good thing about most banks that if you still want to use paper you will be charged a certain amount which people wouldn't want to pay. Doing all this saves up a lot of trees being cut down and we will be able to recycle. The use of computers is good because we won't have to do much also because it saves us a trip to go to the mail and drive there and use gas and pollute the air. This could be a great source that Argentina could use and save most of the garbage disposal.</p>
<p>These three environmental issues in Argentina don't only harm them but also all around the world because it travels. People don't realize what is going around because their busy with their own things but once it starts causing effect on their health or the earth starts crumbling down it is when people will pay attention. That is why it is good to be aware of what's going on to save the earth and make it a better place. Deforestation is just not only happening in Argentina but in many forests around the world and this is causing damage to the earth because most of the planet it is being covered with production and there is less grass that will help sustain the earth. That's including air pollution the more we pollute the air we are risking ourselves to die and cause climate changes at earth that can affect our food production and climate change. And lastly with disposable waste not only in Argentina it is happening but all over the world as well. Us as citizens we should be more responsible and save the place that we are living in which is earth.</p>
