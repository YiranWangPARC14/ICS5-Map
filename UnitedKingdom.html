Environmental issues in United Kingdom<BR>
<BR>
United Kingdom has been dealing with environmental issues for decades. Currently, the three main issues in the United Kingdom are water pollution, air pollution and sea level rise. All of these environmental issues occur over time, and end up polluting the environment day by day. I consider water pollution as the most important issue in the United Kingdom. The country is surrounded by water; therefore, having clean water is extremely important for the people in the country. According to the data base from Natural England, about 80% of marine pollution comes from land based activities. (1) Pollutants enter the sea through direct discharge of effluents. Three main reasons that contribute to the cause of water pollution include road runoffs, drainage system, and nutrients leak. They are all part of a form of the diffuse pollution. Runoffs include the oil and chemical leaks from factories, industries and vehicles. The pollutants may not know how to prevent the pollutions, because they have nowhere else to dump the waste, besides into the water. Varies types of oils and chemicals that are being dumped into the ocean has caused the aquatic life to be heavily polluted. Furthermore, the fishermen capture the contaminated seafood; both the human and aquatic life will turn out to be unhealthy. If toxic leaks into the sea, it will lead to the decline in species. For example, the sea turtles will die from eating plastic bags if the marine toss out garbage. There are bacterial contaminations from the live stocks. Whether the animals are the affected ones or the ones affecting the environment, people have to come up with a plan to prevent those problems. Point source pollution is when the pollution comes from a single identifiable source such as a factory, sewage or drainage system. The drainage system needs to function properly in each household, in order to maintain a clean environment. The environment cannot afford to take in all the leftovers that are being released by each household. Nutrients leak contains high phosphate and nitrate levels in the water system. According to the National Audit Office, the percentage of phosphates and nitrates has been decreasing over the years, from 2000 to 2008, but in order to supply England with clean water, the British government has to spend over ¢G372 million to remove both the pesticides and nitrates from the water system. (2) Right now, only 27% of water bodies in the United Kingdom meet the standards to support the ecosystem. This poor water quality is causing serious environmental and financial costs. <BR>

Air pollution is the second most important environmental issue. This kind of invisible killer already has a record of causing health and environmental damages. There are crucial health affects toward the respiratory and inflammatory systems, along with heart disease and cancer. A report from March 2010 reported that 50,000 people die per year in the United Kingdom due to air pollution. 13,000 premature die in a year and there are 6,000 deaths due to European Union produced outside of United Kingdom. (4) This environmental issue is predicted to lower life expectancy in the country within a decade. If no actions are being conducted, it will directly affect the whole society. In the environmental aspect, air pollution causes damage to plants and animals, along with crop yield and biodiversity. Specific elements that contribute to the pollutants are sulfur dioxide, ammonia, nitrogen oxide and the ozone. The ozone can lead to direct damage to crops and vegetations, which will affect the agricultural life in the United Kingdom; but even though the agriculture is being affected, it is also a pollutant source. The main pollutant source in the United Kingdom is the transportation systems. Defra reported that within the towns and cities, 70% of the air pollution is caused by transport. Another pollutant is the deposition, where the dry deposition of gases and aerosols are being transfer directly to the earth¡¦s surface, and the wet deposition pollutants are removed from the atmosphere by precipitation. British journal reported that air pollution has reached high levels in a number of areas in the country. The pollution level has fluctuated in relation to the weather, in which the weather pattern alters differently every day. <BR>

The third cause is the sea level rise. Since the United Kingdom is an island that surrounds by the water, the issue of sea level rising is more crucial towards the United Kingdom. Sea level rise is the average height of the ocean surface between high and low tides. (6) The level is affected by the strength of gravity around the earth, also being identified as the internal density of the earth. According to last year¡¦s report, sea level is slowly rising by 3.2mm per year. (7) The South Eastern part of the country is sinking compare to the North. The coastal areas are experiencing an increase of flooding, inundation, and erosion as a result of the sea level rise. Approximately 31% of the English coast has build up frontage, 40% of the manufacturing industry is near the coast, and 26 million people live near the coastal urban areas. (5) The coastal areas have more chances to be threatened by the rising tides. A change in the tides and wave conditions that happens overtime determines the change in sea level rise. During the warmer periods, ice melts while the sea level rises, adding more volume to the ocean. In contrast, during the cold periods, water in the ocean evaporates and the ice caps are being stored up in the glacier, which leads to lowering the sea level. The last glacial period the United Kingdom has experienced is the isocratic rebound. The United Kingdom has to deal with the drastic changes between the warm and the cold periods, which messes up the patterns for the scientists to observe the sea level. The reasons behind all the hazardous changes are due to the thermal expansion and the melting of the glaciers. Since the global warming issue is worsening, it allows the temperature to rise and causing the sea level to rise too.<BR>

Even though all three environmental issues I proposed are important issues in the United Kingdom, water pollution has to be the number one problem that people should be concerned about. Water is a necessity in our everyday life. It serves the purpose for our drinking source, drainage system, and other daily needs. If the water pollution is causing all sorts of sickness and problems in society, then we would not even have the chance to take care of the other environmental problems. Unlike the water pollution that can happen overnight, air pollution is an issue in progress. Both of the issues are health related, so it is hard to judge which one is more important. But since humans need water to survive every day, and the air is slowly degenerating, I would have to pick the one that we rely on the most. Sea level may seem like the most dangerous to our environment and the earth, it is not something that we humans have control over, we may be the ones causing global warming, but we have so little power over fixing a nature¡¦s disaster. It is important to pay attention to the sea level rise, but if we have to choose a priority we should choose to face the problem that occurs at a faster speed.

Information technology becomes part of our life to a point where we rely on the source for all purposes. A particular information technology that I chose is the computer programs. Computer program is a broad subject in terms of information technology. It is related to both the water pollution and the air pollution. There are multiple ways of relating computer systems to the two issues. There could be systems that are set up to monitor the water that are being released by each household. Information technology serves the purpose of transporting information to the data base. The plan is to monitor the conditions of drainage system and allowing the data base to the show the results. Another reason is for the purpose of having clean drinking water. Computer system can be set up to filter out how much phosphate and nitrate is contained in the water. Air pollution is a bit harder to measure with computer programs. Instead of measuring the atmosphere for air pollution, there can be commercials on the internet to suggest people to use more public transportations rather than their private vehicles, that way transports can reduce the air pollution in the country. The main purpose of information technology is to assist us with easier access and to provide productivity tools to increase efficiency. <BR>
