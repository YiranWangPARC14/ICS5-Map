<BR><P ALIGN=Left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Japan is known to be a significant power within the world’s nations today with an immense population residing within a comparably small geographical size.  The Japanese have been pioneers for various forms of information technology that has transformed Japan into a technological icon. After World War II, Japan began to expand into a more industrialized nation, and from that point on, several serious environmental issues surfaced. Three major environmental concerns in Japan are changing climates, waste from nuclear power, and shortages of the fish supply due to a surplus in fishery. Fortunately, Japan is widely aware of these environmental challenges and are actively making an effort to find solutions to create a more sustainable nation.
<BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The most concerning environmental issue facing Japan is climate change due to global warming. As an industrialized nation, Japan emits a great deal of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases that cause global warming and a difference in their climate. This is their leading issue due to the circumstance that they do not have control over other countries’ emissions which affects the world, while indirectly affecting Japan as well. Japan acknowledges that climate change is a significant concern for their country, so they have consistently made an effort for the past few decades to reduce emissions and find more sustainable sources of power. During the 1990s, Japan decreased emissions by approximately two percent, making them rank eighth in the world based on findings from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Japan developed standards for energy efficiency, and strayed away from using oil as an energy source and looked more into nuclear power (Moran). The Japanese created more public transportation and implemented programs to educate citizens about climate change. Based on data provided by the OECD, Japan’s greenhouse gas emissions dropped six percent from the 1990s to 2008. Although climate change will remain a top environmental concern for the Japanese, substantial active efforts are being made to battle global warming. 
<BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Japan’s second most significant environmental issue would be their use of nuclear power for energy. After efforts to reduce global warming, Japan has worked towards using nuclear power for energy instead of oil. Instead of focusing on more self-sustainable energy resources, the Japanese focused on nuclear power which led to further environmental conflicts. According to the World Nuclear Association (WNA), eighty-six percent of the resources and equipment needed for nuclear power to function is imported from other nations. This method of creating energy harms the environment by relying on outside resources which causes Japan to stray farther away from self-sustainability. Currently, nuclear reactors supply approximately thirty percent of Japan’s entire energy supply (Nuclear). Following the Fukushima nuclear disaster in 2011, where a tsunami caused nuclear meltdowns and the release of radioactive materials, Japan is projected to reduce reliance on nuclear power from thirty percent to fifty percent by 2040 (McCurry). Efforts towards a more sustainable energy source are still being developed for this major environmental issue.
<BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A third and less pressing environmental concern, in comparison to global warming and nuclear power, would be the excess of fishery among fishermen in Japan. Seafood is a very significant aspect of Japanese culture and diet, therefore the issue of overfishing is controversial among the Japanese. As the population of Japanese grow, the demand for fish increases as well, causing exploitations of marine resources for the fish industry. According to Winifred Bird, a journalist living in Japan from Yale University, Japan consumes approximately six percent of the world’s fish supply and imports more of it than any other nation. The amount of fish being brought in by Japanese fishermen has been continuously diminishing along with the fish supply. This issue of overfishing is detrimental towards the environment and has developed conflicts within the Japanese fish industry. Many outside environmental groups such as WWF, Greenpeace, and the Sustainable Fisheries Partnership have stepped in and endorsed campaigns against exploitation of marine resources (Bird). Japan’s third most influential environmental issue of overfishing has led to much controversy, and notions are being made to create more sustainable seafood.
<BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The most important environmental issue facing Japan is global warming. Second, would be the use of nuclear power for energy and third is the exploitation of marine resources for consumption. Global warming is the most pressing issue, because other countries’ emissions also affect Japan in a negative way, making it harder for Japan to battle this environmental conflict. Nuclear power is second, because it was developed as a result of global warming to find other energy resources that do not release greenhouse gases. This is also a very important issue because it relies on other countries’ resources to supply nuclear reactors and methods of sustainable energy are still underdeveloped. The third issue of overfishing was chosen as the least important, for the reason that fish consumption has a great deal to do with Japanese culture. Japan has other methods of consuming protein however having a sustainable source of seafood would be a luxury to them. 
<BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Information technology (IT) and the use of nuclear reactors in Japan are heavily associated with each other. According to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), configuration and design of the power plant is essential in its ability to perform safely and reliably. The modernization of information technology in configuration management (CM) in nuclear power plants is a vital key in making nuclear reactors more efficient and available (Information). New software and program developments have improved information retrieval and retention within these plants. The application of information technology to nuclear power provides a system that has the ability to automate and guarantee a concise and operative capture, processing, and distribution of critical nuclear power plant information (Information). Overall, information technology has led these potentially dangerous nuclear power plants into becoming a more efficient and safe mechanism of creating energy.
<BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many nuclear power plants within Japan are over a decade or two old. With the utilization of new software provided by information technology, modifications to old configuration management systems within each plant can be made for a more up to date mechanism. This has led to more consistent and dependable information retrieval and retention within the power plant (Information 1). New safety and operational requirements of nuclear power plants are issued within Japan, and the only way to keep the system up to date is with modifications through information technology and programming. When operators are up to date, energy production is more efficient and profits for each plant will increase as well. Personnel that is in charge of monitoring the power plant also benefits from up to date information technology by having proper systems to work with that are reliable and safe for the worker. Information technology overall is the key component to developing functional and effective configuration management systems that run nuclear power plants in Japan. 
<BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nuclear power plant availability within Japan is due largely in part to advancements in software and information technology for configuration management. According to the IAEA, nuclear power plants across the world have increased their availability factors by more than ten percent within the last decade. Information technology and modifications to management systems have increased the potential of power plant availability to higher levels, way into the future (Information 2). Another necessity that nuclear power plants need from information technology is consistent software testing and system maintenance. Regular system checks are crucial to the longevity of a functional configuration management system in cases of debugging and updates or modifications. For nuclear reactors in Japan, information technology is a constant variable in order to sustain a plant’s energy production.
<BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Information technology is always changing, and discoveries of today may be advancements of the past in the near future (Information 2). The challenge for nuclear power plants in Japan is to stay updated and have an up-to-date configuration management system that will keep a plant functioning for a long period of time. This role that information technology plays is indirectly connected to the environmental issue of nuclear power within Japan today. Information technology has made it more efficient and effective for Japan to use nuclear plants for energy, whereas they should be researching for self-sustainable energy. These advancements in information technology contribute negatively to the environment, therefore methods of utilizing information technology for reasons of self-sustainability is a much needed alternative. Information technology in Japan is evolving consistently, giving this nation many opportunities to use software to promote sustainability, and reduce detrimental effects to the environment from using nuclear power.
