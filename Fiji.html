Environmental Issues
<br><br>
<p>Among the many environmental issues that are occurring in Fiji, the three main issues that stood out seemed to be waste disposal, degradation and deforestation. Waste disposal has caused Fiji to have economical issues. The people of Fiji have failed to properly dispose of liquid and solid wastes, which has caused them to have conflicts with the environment. Another problem that follows waste disposal is pollution. Pollution is caused because of poor waste disposal.  In the article, “Priority Environmental Concerns in Fiji” many experts have commented on the particular environmental issue of waste disposal. This list would include experts such as, Sher Singh, Sandip Narayan, Samuela Lagilagi, Sakaraia Serau, and many more.  These experts have all commented on the current waste disposal issues of Fiji. The fact that the citizens of Fiji do not show much care for their land is expressed through their treatment to the land. As stated in the work of Priority Environmental Concerns in Fiji, the main conflict of solid waste disposal is rubbish dump, and for liquid waste disposal is sewerage. Rajendra Pratap states, “Improper solid waste disposal - litter, household and industry waste. Lautoka rubbish dump is also catering for Nadi, Island Resorts and resident rubbish. Waste water problem - Sewerage, FSC mill waste, oil waste from Punjas and Soap factories discharging into foreshores”  (Priority Environmental Issues in Fiji pg. 21). Due to the fact that there is no rubbish dump, all the trash that is supposed to be in the rubbish dump is littered and dumped into rivers or the ocean. Liquid waste can vary in items that are incorrectly disposed; these items include dye and oil. Madhukar Mudaliar also states, “Deterioration in freshwater quality from pollution, improper agricultural practices and long-term cultural/social impact (sewage, etc)” (Priority Environmental Issues in Fiji pg. 22). Due to this problem of waste disposal, it also causes fresh water to have issues as well. In some rural parts of the country, enough fresh water cannot be provided. The products of dye and oil are affecting the fresh waters of the country-causing there to be a shortage in fresh water, which is a necessity in life. Furthermore, human health has also been jeopardized by the pollution of fresh waters. Baleikanacea said in a statement, “pollution has caused environmental degradation impacting human health, affecting food security, quality of drinking water, and economic opportunities” (Saverio Baleikanacea). Therefore, pollution and waste disposal seemed to be the top environmental issue of Fiji. </P>
<p>Second, degradation has impacted Fiji in a way in which it has polluted the international waters. The poor use of resources of the marine life causes degradation. Fiji needs to use its resources so that rate of pollution can decrease and so that they can utilize its resources the correct way. Furthermore, protecting their resources and using them to their advantage will prevent the continuation of degradation. An example of degradation that is occurring currently in Fiji is the destruction of coral reefs in the international waters. Nutrients and other additives are inputted into the soils, which in runoffs, causes a negative impact on the marine life. Another aspect that assists degradation is unsustainability. This is due to the fact that natural pollution is poured into the international waters. Furthermore, the fishermen bait their prey in harmful manners that cause unsustainability. Winnie Nainoca from the Fiji Institute of Technology includes “River water degradation (freshwater) due to pollution by improper disposal of community rubbish, sedimentation from erosion due to unsustainable farming method, gravel mining, farm run-offs (fertilisers, animal wastes)” (Priority Environmental Concerns in Fiji p. 19) This explains that fresh waters of the rivers have been impacted negatively due to the harmful fishing practices; furthermore, the pollution that occurs in the rivers is also causing the fresh waters of Fiji to be constantly concerned. Banuve Kaumaitotoya also stated “Unsustainable land use - improper cultivation techniques. Unsustainable fishing practices.” (Priority Environmental Concerns in Fiji p. 22)  From this we can examine that the wrong and harmful fishing practices were negatively impacting the waters of Fiji. This particular environmental issue of degradation seemed significantly large in the country of Fiji due to the concern that Fiji is putting into it. </P>
<p>Deforestation has also become an economical concern for the country of Fiji. Basically, deforestation easily defined is the removal of trees. Deforestation is usually a concern for those particular areas with many trees, such as forests. A problem that deforestation could cause is soil erosion. A couple of reasons why people cut down the trees to cause deforestation could be because of firewood or wood for building houses but another main reason for deforestation is the poor logging practices used by people. "This is through the shallowing of the rivers by erosion of soil into the rivers.” According to the FijiTimes, due to the cutting down of trees for various reasons, the soil could easily erode which can also lead to pollution of waters near the forests. Soil erosion could cause the soil in the water to deteriorate resulting in rivers and other waters to become shallow. In the “Encyclopedia of Earth” it states that the cyclonic storms occur throughout a couple of months due to the deforestation and soil erosion that is currently causing an issue in Fiji. Even through the significant loss of trees, the forests of Fiji are considered to be one of the largest in its region. This environmental issue of deforestation and soil erosion,  seemed to be one of the top most concerned problems in Fiji. </p> 
<p>An information technology that has a relationship with deforestation is cell phones. Cell phones can help with the particular environmental issue of trees being cut down unnecessarily.  For example, instead of having to send letters through mail you can simply type them an email through your phone, or send a text message, or even make a phone call. This will improve efficiency as well because mailmen will not have to deliver paper mail as much. Cell phones have made everything more time efficient and cost efficient. Through the invention of cell phones, people do not have to use as much paper, which saves the trees, which therefore is a successful way to prevent deforestation. In an article posted on discovery.com states, “5. Makes banking services accessible In Kenya, owners of tiny, mom-and-pop businesses who don't have access to commercial banking can gain access to credit via cell phones. In South Africa, Mongi said, a service called Wizzit allows anybody with a mobile phone to make person-to-person payments, transfers and pre-paid purchases without a bank account.” (Niki Denison Discovery Channel) Cell phones nowadays have been upgraded to the point where people do not need to get bills mailed to them or make notes onto the phone without using post it notes or have reminders on your calendar on your phone rather than a paper calendar. These things all help prevent the environmental conflict of deforestation. Technology has advanced significantly enough to make peoples lives much easier than it was before. </p>
