Environmental Issues in Jordan
<br>
<br>
Jordan, which lies in the heart of the Middle East, carries many historical weight on its shoulders. Tourists from all over the world visit the desert country to visit places such as the Dead Sea and Petra. Yet Jordan faces huge ecological issues that are unseen by many of these tourists. These ecological issues play a huge role in the direction of the country and with new technological advancements taking place, they still cannot find the right solutions for their issues. My aim in this paper is highlight many ecological  issues in Jordan and to show the steps in how the government tried to implement IT systems to solve certain issues but failed for several reasons. The three main issues that I came up with were all detailed on the governments website as the three primary issues that Jordan faces (1). 
<br>
	Jordan which lies in the heart of the Middle East is considered a Bedouin country. About 80 percent of Jordan's land is considered a desert (2). The other 20 percent which lies primarily in the North -- a region that is very close to Syria-- is used for agriculture but has very little water for it to flourish. The biggest issue in Jordan today is water supply. As stated in the government's website, Jordan “ stands face to face with the reality of potentially frightening water shortages.”(3). Some of the water can be found within mountains that are close to the Dead Sea yet the issue is that it just does not supply enough water. And when we take a look at the Dead Sea, which is called the Dead Sea because of its high concentration of salt, cannot be used as drinking water for the people. In fact, one huge issue that Jordan faces pointed out in this New York Post article was that the Dead Sea has “ dropped a record 4.9 feet over the past 12 months because of industry use and evaporation.”(4). The use of IT systems allows for the separation of salt and water to sell salt products such as body lotions or any type of skin care. It does bring several jobs to the region yet it makes the issue at hand much worse and it does not play as a viable solution to Jordan's ecological issue. 
<br>
	One way that the Jordanian government tried to solve the huge water supply issue was to supply water connection of the Disi (a water reservoir) all the way to the capital, Amman. This was definitely a great idea which took about 4 years to build. The project was contracted to a Turkish company that promised to finish the project within two years (5). The project never finished for several reasons. One, it turns out that the water actually has radiation and might be potentially harmful for the people. Two, the level of corruption within the government never allowed for the money to actually reach the contractors. Hence the cash flowed within many government officials and when it was time to pay the contractors, it just never happened because there was no cash left. Jordan is considered as the 4th poorest nation in water supply and yet it cannot find any way to alleviate this issue (5). Many projects have been undertaken to find the right solution but no solution has been found for whatever reason. The main issue that Jordan faces is that their is no internal water resource that they can easily use. And after implementing several projects such as the Disi project, the internal resource of water is either contaminated or very low on supply to help solve the issue. 
<br>
	Jordan's ecological number does not stop with only water. Another huge issue is the misuse of land and technology that allows for the people to destroy animal habitat and wildlife. Most of the animals in Jordan are camels which can easily survive in deserts and are still used as some of the people's primary transportation system. In the northern region is where many other animals live such as sheep, goat, cows and gazelles. Slowly, these animal are becoming distinct because of the use of new technological tools such as the tractor, shovel, mining tools and other various agriculture tools that destroy the land in the northern region (3). Many people that decide to move out of the city because of its heavy traffic and high land prices want to live up North because of the agricultural richness. Yet, they are uneducated in terms on how to properly take over land, they take down trees that birds nest on. They destroy caves which serves as a home property for many mammals in the region. With the introduction of these new technological tools it made it much easier for the people to move outside of the city towards the rural areas (6). In fact, the tradition was for the rural people, such as farmers, should move into the city because of high advanced outlook on life. Yet because of the soaring prices, many people are planning to move outside of the city where they can obtain bigger chunks of land for cheaper prices. But it comes as a cost to the animal habitat due to uneducated understanding that the people do not have. The tradition in Jordan is to just take over the land, and use whatever is necessary to construct the way the way you want it. They do not take into account animal habitat or any environmental regulations that would stop them from doing so. Yet they see that these new technological tools actually help them and the country expand in many positive ways (6). 
<br>
	One solution that the government tried to market was the “Wild Jordan” campaign (8). Its purpose is to “develop socio-economic programs in all of Jordan's nature reserves.” (8). Yet the issue here is that the economic situation in Jordan does not allow for the people to put in effort into an initiative like this one. Many people in Jordan live under the poverty line and the “Wild Jordan” initiative was undertaken by a group of tourists who saw the real issues that Jordan faces (2). Yet what we need to understand here is that because of the economic situation that Jordan faces, the people do not care about the wildlife or agriculture, they are just worried about feeding their families and surviving for the next days. The reality in Jordan does not allow for a solution like this to take underway. 
<br>
	Jordan's third biggest issue that it faces right now is the issue of agriculture due to the lack of water resources, increased soil erosion and the current revolution happening in Syria (7). First, the lack of water resources does not allow for the correct nourishment that is supposed to be given to the plants. The increased soil erosion also plays a role in diminishing the nourishment for the plants. And last but not least the revolution in neighboring Syria closes off any importing goods such as cucumbers tomatoes, milk and several other food items. This puts more pressure on the Jordanian farmers to crop more and to yield more vegetables and food, yet they still cannot because of the lack of water and soil erosion. So the government tried to implement a rule by giving several farmers, who fall under certain guidelines, free tractors so they can yield more crops much easily (1). It sounded like a great idea but the issue was that many farmers did not know how to use the tractor. In fact, some of them have never seen a tractor before in their lives. So what ended up happening was the total opposite. It took up so much time for these farmers to gain knowledge on how to use the tractors that they could not start yielding any crops. And by the time they were able to gain some knowledge on the tractors, the season for cropping was over. 
<br>
	As I outlined in this paper, Jordan faces many ecological issues that have huge implications on where the country is heading towards. Each time the government tries to implement new ways to solve their issue they lean towards technological tools that seem so promising yet always fails. In my first example, the Disi water project was something considered as the next greatest thing Jordan because of its perceived success. When I was visiting my family in Jordan, everybody was talking about how great it was that they can finally have easy access to water, yet it still failed. The decline of the Jordanian wildlife was a result of the uneducated use of technological tools that allowed citizens to do whatever they please with their land at the expense of the wildlife. The issue of agriculture in Jordan was hit hard because of the Syrian revolution which stopped the import of goods. It then forced the government to subsidies tools to yield more crops but then backfired on the government and people due to the lack of education on how to use these types of tools. These ecological issues play a huge role in the average citizen's life and they entail that things are not getting better at all. Many technological solutions were implemented but failed for many reasons. It is just a matter of time when the government needs to find better solutions to ensure that the issue does not escalate to a bigger problem than it already is.
