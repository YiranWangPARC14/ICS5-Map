Here is where I'd write my essay...

Finland is a country that proudly promotes environmental and sustainable development. Their goals is to create safe living environments, to defend biodiversity, to prevent environmental damage to homes within Finland. Finland has constantly worked towards modifying climate change on a national level since November of 2008. Finland’s climate change is mostly brought on by greenhouse gas emissions that are brought into the atmosphere as a consequence of human activities. Climate change is a global problem and modifying climate change should be strived by all countries not only Finland. If emissions reduces, action has to occur just to adapt to climate change in Finland. Records show that Finland has had the heaviest rainfall in more than a one hundred and fifty years. The atmospheric humidity, decides the strength of heavy rain so fields were then submerged by masses of water and people had to move out of their homes. 
The forests play a very important role in both moderation and adaptation to climate change. Recently, Finland has been fortunate to have warm summers so plants and animals both adapted to the climate. The reduction of deforestation and forest degradation in the climate change agreement could possibly improve opportunities for developing countries to protect biodiversity and reduce poverty. Finland has about five hundred and twelve known species of amphibians, birds, mammals and reptiles. Finland is also home to at least one thousand one hundred and two species of plants. If Finland decides to reduce deforestation it could create benefits such as safety for water reserves, biodiversity and could possibly stop soil erosions. Yet more than one billion people depend on forests as a source of income. 
Finland’s major load of pollutants enter through water bodies in a runoff from farmland, through managed forests and compost mining areas. Pollutants from former contaminated sediments and soils can also filter into the water. Pollutants dumped in the atmosphere can also damage the state of water. In November 2006 the Government approved a new set of water protection proposals up to the year of 2015, it was created to set a way for water safety methods and the planning of river basin management for Finland. The main objectives are to reduce the nutrient loads that cause eutrophication (when a body of water improves in dissolved nutrients), reducing the risks associated with hazardous substances, reducing the harmful impacts of hydrological engineering and water level regulation, protecting groundwater bodies, protecting aquatic biodiversity, and restoring ecologically damaged water bodies. These particular objectives are taken to develop new actions to improve the state of rivers. Finland is now known as an environmentally friendly country due to these positive proposals that are slowly saving the country.
