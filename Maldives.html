    <BR><BR>The Republic of Maldives is an archipelago, a cluster of islands unified as a nation, of 1,192 coral islands located 400km south-west of India in the Indian Ocean.  The beauty of these islands attracts tourists from all around the world. Surrounded by the endless sea, tourists enjoy the breeze from the Indian Ocean and the softness of the sand; however, this gorgeous country will soon be gone. Maldives, the country with the lowest sea level in the world, is being threatened by a total submergence due to environmental issues including climate change, a rising sea level, and water pollution. With its natural highest ground level of seven feet and ten inches; the majority of the land is four inches or less above the sea level, (1)Maldives is in danger of being swamped by the Indian Ocean. The most important environmental issue is world climate change, because it directly causes the second environmental dilemma of a rising sea level, which has strong impact on the survival of this archipelago. Water pollution is the third most important issue, because though this remains a major problem for Maldives, this problem has the easiest and quickest solutions with the least amount of damage threatening the nation. 
    <BR><BR>The Earth is warming. “Scientific studies show that for each decade of the last 30 years, global surface temperature has increased approximately 2°C” (2). With this rate, the ice which is frozen in north and south pole will melt much faster than usual. Which is proven in the next article :“The rapidity of sea ice disappearance is evidence that the initiation of a positive environmental feedback loop wherein sunlight that normally would be reflected by the ice is instead absorbed by dark blue seawater, speeding warming and melting.”(3) According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), global sea levels will rise by between 3.5 to 14.6 inches. “Even with modest increases in greenhouse gas emission, summer sea ice is expected to vanish by the end of the century” (4). Some low sea level countries will be swamp by the water. With the majority of twelve hundred islands lying less than one meter above sea level, Maldives’ very existence is threated by the climate change and rising sea level. Not only is the increasing sea level threatening, but powerful storms, increased beach erosion, and higher storm surges are more devastating effects of global climate change that directly affect this cluster of islands (4). Much of Maldives’ most disastrous problems are based upon the fluctuating change in climate; thus, climate change is the most critical environmental issue in Maldives. 
    <BR><BR>All of the islands of the Maldives are extremely sensitive to rising sea levels due to the low sea level. With the country's highest point is only seven feet and ten inches above sea level, global warming is causing glaciers and polar ice caps to melt, leading to a rise in sea levels(5). If sea levels rise enough, the entire country could disappear under water. Rising sea levels threaten the entire existence of the Maldives. “Furthermore, the sea threatens the habitat of every human, plant, and land animal in Maldives. Humans could be easily relocated to other neighboring countries, but preventing bio-diversity and species loss would be difficult.” (6)(7) Additionally, introduce a sudden rush of plants and animals to a new ecosystem could also be problematic and upset the natural balance of that ecosystem (8). “The newly-introduced plants and animals could become invasive or the domestic plants and animals could eradicate those ‘rescued’ from the sinking Maldives.”(9) As the rising ocean levels threaten the Maldives, the country’s residents will be forced emigrate to neighboring nations, such as India or Sri Lanka (9), though animal and plant natives to Maldives may suffer even further without the ability to relocate. This therefore makes the rising sea level in Maldives an issue that needs to quickly be addressed. 
    <BR><BR>“The water resources of the Maldives comprise of fresh groundwater that occurs in the porous coral sediments on many islands of the Maldives.”(10) Maldivians has been dependent on groundwater from wells which dug in the ground for centuries. “The majority of the population uses rainwater and desalinated water for drinking and groundwater for other purposes. People will collect rain water in tanks (10). “Because the water table is found at such shallow depths, they are particularly prone to pollution from the human activities that take place on the surface. Groundwater is recharged by rainfall but becomes contaminated while percolating through the soil, which is generally polluted with organic and human wastes”(11). Also, according to 1990 statistics, 98 percent of the urban population in the city of Male and 57 percent of the rural population on the atolls had access to safe drinking water. If, however, Maldivians reduce ground pollution, the underground water will not be contaminated and the cleanliness of the water supply will improve dramatically. This is an important issue which should be addressed, but it is not currently seen as the most detrimental to Maldives.
    <BR><BR>Climate Services for Maldives by Foundation for Environment, Climate, and Technology (FECT) is a non-profit company set up in 2012 and capitalizes on the 5-year long work with the Ministry of Environment, Columbia University, and other organizations which lead to unique capabilities in climate adaptation for Maldives (13). By using information technology such as monitoring the change in climate, prediction technologies and advances in computing, satellite imaging and communication technologies, FECT predicts potential impact and risks. Using these measures will better help assess and solve the environmental problems that need to be addressed. “There has been inadequate use of the latest climate science for adaptation, risk management and policy-making. Climate variability and climate change poses compelling challenges for the Maldives. Further interactions have followed through a series of visits with other Agencies under the Ministry of Environment.”(13) These interactions have led to the development of an action plan for capacity building for climate services, collaborative climate research and the development of web based tools for climatic analysis, monitoring and predictions for the Maldives. (14)
    <BR><BR>FECT uses satellite imaging technology to study the climatology of Maldives, which refers to the average conditions experienced historically for a given month.  For example: “Usually the climatology is a good guide to what one may expect in a given month absent other information.  For example, the historical average rainfall for the Northern islands is high in July (200-250 mm), higher in August (250- 300 mm) and drops in September & October (100- 200 mm).  In the Central Islands rainfall is usually moderate (150- 200 mm) during the August – October period. Heavy rainfall is typical for the Southern Islands during these four months. The winds over the Northern & Central Islands are usually westerly (from West to East) and wind speeds are expected to be high. For Southern Islands, low wind speeds are expected for July and August but stronger westerly winds in September and October (15).”With all this information, people in Maldives will have a better understanding of its climate change, which helps them to not only better plan their lives but also make changes essential to the nation’s survival. This would be impossible without the help of information technology. 
 <BR><BR>Information technology and climate change have a strong, close relationship with one other, because by using information technology, individuals and communities can assess the data gathered and make changes that directly affect the climate change. The environmental issues Maldives are facing are serious and deadly and may possibly wipe out the country as a whole, causing loss of life, biodiversity, and an abundance of other problems. With the help of information technology, people will be able to decrease the damage from natural disasters as well as manmade issues and prevent any more human error contributing to the Maldivian doomsday. <BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>
