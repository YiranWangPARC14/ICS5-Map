<BR><BR>The Republic of Maldives is an archipelago of 1,192 coral islands located 400km south-west of India in the Indian Ocean.  The beauty of these islands attracts tourists from all around the world. Surrounded by the endless sea, tourists enjoy the breeze from the Indian Ocean and the softness of the sand. However, this gorgeous country will soon be gone. Environmental issues including climate change, sea-level rises, and water pollution are causing this country to disappear. Maldives is the lowest sea level country in the world.(1) With its natural highest ground level of seven feet and ten inches; the majority of the land is four inches or less above the sea level, Maldives is in danger of being swamped by the Indian Ocean. I consider the world-wide climate change as the most important environmental issue. It directly causes the sea-level rise which has strong impact on the survival of this archipelago. Water pollution may be the third most important issue, it is not because it is the least important issue, but it is changeable and has less damage on Maldives. These three environmental issues will determine the endurance of Maldives.
<BR><BR>The Earth is warming. Scientific studies show that for each decade of the last 30 years, global surface temperature has increased approximately 2°C, consistent with initial rates predicted by 1980s climatological modeling (2). An additional increase of 2-3°C would make the Earth as warm as it was 3 million years ago, when the sea level was about 80 feet higher than today . The rapidity of sea ice disappearance is evidence that the initiation of a positive environmental feedback loop wherein sunlight that normally would be reflected by the ice is instead absorbed by dark blue seawater, speeding warming and melting.(3) According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), global sea levels will rise by between 3.5 to 14.6 inches. Even with modest increases in greenhouse gas emission, summer sea ice is expected to vanish by the end of the century (4). With the majority of twelve hundred islands lying less than one meter above sea level, climate change will threaten Maldives’s existence. Not only is the rising sea level threating, but so are powerful storms, increased beach erosion, and higher storm surge which are caused by global climate change. Maldives is facing a disastrous problem. Thus, I consider climate change is the most important environmental issue in Maldives. 
<BR><BR>All of the islands of the Maldives are extremely sensitive to rising sea levels. Indeed, the country's highest point is only seven feet and ten inches above sea level. Global warming is causing glaciers and polar ice caps to melt, leading to a rise in sea levels. If sea levels rise enough, the entire country could disappear under water. Rising sea levels threaten the entire existence of the Maldives. Furthermore, the sea threatens the habitat of every human, plant, and land animal in Maldives. Humans could be easily relocated to other neighboring countries, but preventing bio-diversity and species loss would be difficult. (6) Additionally, introducing those plants and animals to a new ecosystem could also be problematic and upset the natural balance of that ecosystem.(8) The newly-introduced plants and animals could become invasive or the domestic plants and animals could eradicate those "rescued" from the sinking Maldives. As the rising ocean levels threaten the Maldives, the country’s residents will be forced to move to other countries, such as India or Sri Lanka. Hence, sea level rises is the second most important environmental issue in Maldives.
<BR><BR>The water resources of the Maldives comprise of fresh groundwater that occurs in the porous coral sediments on many islands of the Maldives. The population of Maldives has traditionally been dependent on groundwater from shallow wells dug in the ground. The majority of the population uses rainwater and desalinated water for drinking and groundwater for other purposes. Rainwater is tapped from roofs and collected and stored in various types of tanks. All the islands have individual household as well as community tanks.  However, the situation is different in the capital island Male where the whole population has access to desalinated water distributed through a piped network. Maldives’ groundwater resources are therefore vulnerable in a number of ways. (10) Because the water table is found at such shallow depths, they are particularly prone to pollution from the human activities that take place on the surface. Groundwater is recharged by rainfall but becomes contaminated while percolating through the soil, which is generally polluted with organic and human wastes. Also, according to 1990 statistics, 98 percent of the urban population in the city of Male and 57 percent of the rural population on the atolls had access to safe drinking water. (11)However, if people in Maldives reduce pollution on the ground, the water will not be contaminated, therefore, decline water pollution in Maldives. As a result, I consider water pollution as the third most important environmental issues in Maldives.
<BR><BR>Climate Services for Maldives by Foundation for Environment, Climate, and Technology (FECT) is a non-profit company set up in 2012 and capitalizes on the 5 year long work with the Ministry of Environment, Columbia University and other organizations which lead to unique capabilities in climate adaptation for Maldives.(13) By using information technology such as monitoring, prediction technologies and advances in computing, satellite imaging and communication technologies, FECT predicts potential impact and risks. There has been inadequate use of the latest climate science for adaptation, risk management and policy-making. Climate variability and climate change poses compelling challenges for the Maldives. Further interactions have followed through a series of visits with other Agencies under the Ministry of Environment. These interactions have led to the development of an action plan for capacity building for climate services, collaborative climate research and the development of web based tools for climatic analysis, monitoring and predictions for the Maldives. 
 <BR><BR>   FECT uses satellite imaging technology to study the climatology of Maldives, which refers to the average conditions experienced historically for a given month.  Usually the climatology is a good guide to what one may expect in a given month absent other information.  For example, the historical average rainfall for the Northern islands is high in July (200-250 mm), higher in August (250- 300 mm) and drops in September & October (100- 200 mm).  In the Central Islands rainfall is usually moderate (150- 200 mm) during the August – October period. Heavy rainfall is typical for the Southern Islands during these four months. The winds over the Northern & Central Islands are usually westerly (from West to East) and wind speeds are expected to be high. For Southern Islands, low wind speeds are expected for July and August but stronger westerly winds in September and October.(14) With all this information, people in Maldives will have a better understanding of its climate change which helps them to plan their lives. They could never have done that without the help of information technology. 
  <BR><BR>  Information technology and climate change have a strong, close relationship with each other. The environmental issues Maldives are facing are serious and deadly. With the help of information technology, people will be able to decrease the damage from natural disasters, which might result the delay of Maldives’s doomsday.
