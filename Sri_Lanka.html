<BR>Environmental Issues in Sri Lanka
<BR><BR>
<BR>Sri Lanka was a third world country that has now economically improved into a developing country.  Since the early 1980s, Sri Lanka has rapidly improved its economy and has undergone quick and efficient industrialization, which thus also increased its energy consumption.  Consequently, this paved way for more motor vehicles which in turn proved to be detrimental to Sri Lanka’s environment and wildlife.  Although Sri Lanka has made an efficient effort to develop and nurture its environment compared to other countries in South Asia, severe environmental issues have come up due to little dedication and knowledge to conserve the environment from Sri Lanka’s residents.  There are many environmental issues in Sri Lanka, but the most harmful and increasing problems in Sri Lanka are deforestation, water pollution, and air pollution, respectively.  This order of importance in issues with Sri Lanka’s environment is determined by the number of significant problematic events that have occurred within each environmental issue.
<BR><BR>
<BR>Deforestation has proved to be the most detrimental predicament for Sri Lanka because of the large number of forests that had been eliminated for more plantations and agricultural land.  Sri Lanka is a big and major producer of tea, and the deforestation has provided enough room for these tea plantations to produce this significant resource and raise the country’s revenue.  Although the removal of Sri Lanka’s forests has provided land, it has also caused many environmental problems as well.  For example, deforestation has caused soil erosion, landslides, flooding, and has effectively damaged the wildlife and biodiversity in these forests.  Furthermore, maintaining the remaining environmental forests has proved to be a dilemma as well because of Sri Lanka’s demand and dependence on timber and fuel, and the fact that Sri Lanka’s government policies are heavily focused on tree plantations and timber production.  Not only does deforestation have an impact on the environment and biodiversity, but also to the human health as well.  “…deforestation has still affected the lives of every day people in some parts of Sri Lanka where removal of forests has resulted in greater time and energy being spent gathering firewood typically by women…affecting their health and well-being” (Sunday 1).
<BR><BR>
<BR>Apart from deforestation being the most detrimental issue to Sri Lanka, water pollution is an increasing issue that comes right after deforestation.  Water pollution in Sri Lanka has increased ever since the country has started developing because of the accumulating number of industries that emit a significant amount of environmental contaminants, which all contribute to polluting the water bodies in Sri Lanka.  Water pollution is an important issue that needs to be solved because of the insufficient amount of pure water is available to only 25% of all households in Sri Lanka.  Consequently, this pollution of water causes many water borne diseases and health impairments to all residents of Sri Lanka, specifically children.  The two most polluted lakes in Sri Lanka are the Beira Lake and the Kandy Lake.  These lakes are heavily polluted with “regular outbreaks of algal blooms arising from eutrophication…the increased organic content in water bodies depletes oxygen and affects fish populations” (Ileperuma 11).  Furthermore, the increasing amount of garbage disposal is also deleteriously affecting the environment because of the lack of infrastructure for garbage collection.  All this toxic garbage is then led to the sewers, which then lead to pollute the water bodies that it runs into.  This contributes to much of the health problems and the pollution of the atmosphere.
<BR><BR>
<BR>Lastly, air pollution is an expanding environmental issue in Sri Lanka that causes much of the health problems of the residents of Sri Lanka.  Air pollution can also lead to the deaths of aged people who are liable of heart diseases.  Since the improvement of Sri Lanka as a developing country, the number of motor vehicles and toxic chemical emissions has additionally increased.  For example, a colorless and toxic air pollutant called carbon monoxide is widely and excessively emitted by the motor vehicles, which is very detrimental to the health and well-being of individuals who breathe the high concentrations of carbon monoxide.  “During peak traffic hours…urban areas such as Colombo, Kandy, Gampaha, Negombo, Kegalle, Kurunegala, Moratuwa, Galle, Kalutara, and Matale face severe air pollution” (Urlaub 1).  Due to the heavily congested traffic in these areas of Sri Lanka, the amount of primary air pollutants and smog that is emitted to the atmosphere is increasing exponentially, with much help from extremely polluting diesel vehicles and big freight trucks.  “Motor vehicles continue to be the most significant contributor to air pollution where the fleet sizes have almost doubled in the decade 1990-2000” (Ileperma 2).
<BR><BR>
<BR>In order to reach a solution and prevent these environmental harms, Sri Lanka must develop technologically by dealing with more advanced and up to date information technology.  Much of these environmental issues can be solved through the use of information technology, which can provide the knowledge and information that Sri Lanka needs to environmentally improve and develop.  For example, the use of computers in general can prove to be a great influence in preventing these environmental harms because computers can provide every bit of knowledge from around the world that includes information on how to exemplify, deal, solve, and prevent environmental issues such as air pollution.  It can provide knowledge to people who are not well informed of the hazards and harmful effects of air pollution, which will provoke them to seek further knowledge on how to prevent and deal with air pollution.  People who reside in third world countries and developing countries and are nowhere close to the technological advancements of developed countries can also be greatly influenced by information technology.  Furthermore, people will also be able to use these information technology computers to look for different methods of measuring and treating air pollution and find the most effective and efficient way of reducing air pollution.  “Technology can be a very useful tool, as it is able to facilitate distance learning and this method has been used by several non-government organizations to reach children and women in rural areas” (Dasanayaka 11).  Information technology plays a great role in air pollution and other environmental concerns because of the fact that it can influence environmentalists and all residents of Sri Lanka to reach a solution and provide the power and capability to enforce these solutions.
<BR><BR>
<BR>The technology that is used to measure and monitor affected areas of air pollution are also considered as influential information technology.  For example, a station had been set and located at Colombo Fort in Sri Lanka in 1997.  This station’s purpose was to monitor Sri Lanka’s air quality on a continuous basis, for every five minutes.  The air quality was monitored by a continuous automated monitoring computer, which provided data on the amount of emissions of CO, NO2, O3, SO2, and PM10.  This information technology is particularly useful and influential to Sri Lanka and its environmental issue of air pollution because it provides information and data on pollution levels, which scientists can then use to know when air pollution is at its worst and how these deleterious effects of air pollution can be treated and solved.  They were also able to compare these emission data to other countries data, to see whether or not these emission levels were normal or not and thus act on finding a solution to lessen the air pollution if toxic levels were higher.  “Special 24-hour measurements for the purpose of the inter-country comparison were carried out at the Colombo Fort monitoring station on a weekly basis using the Gent stacked filter unit particle samples” (Nandasena 1).  In addition, mobile air quality monitoring laboratories are used to carry out mobile monitoring activities in some cities in Sri Lanka.
<BR><BR>
<BR>Based on observational and recorded data, scientists can also use information technology and computers to develop an air pollution computer model that can develop accurate and reliable forecasts on air pollution.  “The model was made to predict carbon monoxide, but its underlying principles and innovations could also be used to work with CO2 and other greenhouse gases” (Richard 1).  In addition, scientists can use these computer models to exemplify such conditions and situations in which air pollution is at its highest peak, which is usually during the traffic times in Sri Lanka.  Furthermore, they can use these computer models to simulate reactions that create air pollutants and predict how an area will be affected by the air quality, which will allow them to go more in-depth into the creation and effects of air pollution and thus synthesize new methods and solutions to treating air pollution in Sri Lanka.  In conclusion, information technology plays an important and significant role in a country’s environmental issues because it provides intellect information and knowledge from around the world that will allow people to reach the ideal method and solution to the environmental issue.  People can then also use information technology to gather important data that is relevant and crucial to attaining their goal of an ideal and sustainable environment with no environmental issues and pollution.
