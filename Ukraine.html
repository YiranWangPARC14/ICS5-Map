<br>Ukraine<br>
	Ukraine got its independence in 1991, the technology development grew fast, including urban and agriculture. Ukraine has a good science and technology background. However, due to the economic crisis, the country cannot spend too much financial focus on environment protection. As a result of this, the country has a serious environment problems and these pollution effected Ukrainians on their health. Among them, the top three environment issues that need to be immediately solved are water pollution, air pollution and radiation.
<br>Water Pollution<br>
	According to “Water pollution Issues in an Independent Ukraine”, wrote by N. Nazarov, H. F. Cook and G. Woodgate, published in 2007, Ukraine own a long legacy of industrial. Ukraine also has a high and impressive technology and science support background that could be using for solving environment issues. However, because of the economic crisis in the end of 20 century, the country was lacking of financial resources for recycling the waste water.(Woodgate, 2007) To assess the chemical composition natural water and wastewater, a series of physical 118 0 JCIWEM, 2000, on the 14th, the April water pollutions to control issues in the post-independence Ukraine Method is applied, namely spectrophotometry, gas Chromatography, measured electrically Poor Tomography, and the potential of the method. Some of these to allow accurate measurement of the concentration of certain Substances, for example, oscillate polar graphic Allows measurement of chemicals Parameter is equal to the maximum allowable concentration be registered (MAC) and the following (5). By these methods, Can measure the following parameters: turbidity, pH, organic matter, refined oil, ammonia, nitrate, Nitrite, BHC, chlorophos, methaphos, Cadmium, zinc, copper, nickel, cobalt, chromium vanadium. Currently, the method is developing ecological and analysis of control according to the computerized application automatically technology. However, in fact, adequate methodical provide coordination environment conservation activities along with the economy Industrial Enterprise Management. (Woodgate, 2007).
	<br>From anther research, “Water Pollution in Ukraine: The Search for Possible Solutions” witch is written by Nikolai Nazarov, Hadrian F. Cook and Graham Woodgate in 2004, due to the pollution of the main industrial character, so it can be certain "state" (administrative area unit) : Zaporozhie, Los Angeles Walter don't Dnieper ROM defense base to Scott, Scott and Donetzk (figure 3). In these areas, there are a lot of mining and heavy metallurgical enterprise position, in major cities throughout the country, is the center of the industrial production and provide large municipal sewage treatment facilities. In 1996, the scale of their respective administrative areas, 9 (state) river pollution often increase, and maintain a stable or falling, 16 people minimum error probability minimum-error-probability (MEP, 1998). In 2000, Strengthen pollution of rivers, and points out that, only seven administrative unit minimum error probability minimum-error-probability (MEP, 2002).By the economic crisis, many countries industrial fully closed come down, and other work, its potential is only a small part. Export oriented oil, natural gas, metal processing and agricultural leading enterprises, however, all the time, serious influence. Although there have been some improvement in its economy. ( Nazarov, Cook and Woodgate, 2004)
<br>In the past few years, it did not bring substantial benefits Ukraine's industry and population welfare of the general conditions change. Because of the economic recession as a result, most people's welfare decline significantly since 1990. For example, in 1990, almost no unemployment, the average monthly pays nearly $200. In 2000, the official unemployment rate is 6%. Although the national environmental legislation and policy, stressed the need to protect the environment, the personage inside course of study thinks is not economical to prevent and control pollution (Gritzenko, 1995). This is partly because no consider interest such as pollution control; improve human health, comfortable, save biodiversity and other factors, including the shortage of capital business. ( Nazarov, Cook and Woodgate, 2004)

<br>Radiation<br>
From the “Radiation-Induced Leukemia Risk Among Those Aged 0–20 At The Time Of The Chernobyl Accident: A Case-Control Study In The Ukraine” which is written by Andriy G. Noshchenko, Pavlo V. Zamostyan, Oleksandra Yu. Bondar and Vira D. Drozdova (2002), in 1986, Chernobyl nuclear disaster caused considerable environmental contamination and the corresponding radiation exposure in Ukraine, Belarus, Russia and other millions of people. After the explosion, 203 people were rushed to the hospital for treatment immediately, in which 31 people were killed, among them 28 people died from excessive radiation. Death mostly firefighters and ambulance workers, because they do not know the dangers of radiation accidents contain. In order to control the spread of nuclear fallout, the authorities immediately sent 135,000 people to evacuate their homes, of which about 50,000 people living near Chernobyl residents of the town of Pripyat. The health units forecast in the next 70 years, by the 5-12y radiation to cause cancer, the ratio will be increased by 2%. In addition, it has been exposed to radiation because of the recent accident, 10 people died of cancer. Food restriction April 1986, a number of European countries (the exception of France) has imposed food restrictions, special fungi and milk. 20 years after the disaster, the major limitation of the manufacturing, food contamination from Chernobyl radioactive dust transport and consumption process, especially for the control of the cesium-137 index, in order to prevent them from entering the human food chain. In some areas of Sweden and Finland, part of the meat products are monitored, including antelope living in the natural and near-natural environment in some regions of Germany, Austria, Italy, Sweden, Finland, Lithuania and Poland. Previous studies have indicated that the highest risk of leukemia 0 - 20 years of age between personal happened in exposure time Ionizing radiation (Drozdova 2002). The way to stop spreading the radiation, people used Industrial remote control robot to set up the protection.
<br>Air Pollution<br>
	The research “Air Pollution Costs in Ukraine” witch is written by Elena Strukova, Alexander Golub and Anil Markandya in 2006 showed that Through the United States enacted by the EPA method and adjustment, in Russia, eastern European countries health risk assessment. PM2.5 is regarded as the main source of human health risk, there is no reliable calculation of PM2.5 concentrations, the total suspended particles (TSP) emissions in Ukraine monitoring based on the data of research. Report TSP concentration into PM2.5 data, calculate the risk of mortality and other cases. Then the density - response function, it is estimated that personal risk. Secondly, individual risk report for each city is included in the analysis of concentration, contact with the crowd. For every city, we think of the baseline morbidity and mortality and population structure of personal data. Be in usually, air pollution related mortality Ukraine's total mortality about 6%. In Russia, the risk of death was related to the economic loss estimation for 4% of around 4% of GDP, the corresponding indicator. , therefore, we in the Ukraine interests transfer method is used to estimate, because death is due to air pollution health loss of main parts. Then, about 30% of the air pollution health loads the total incidence of a disease. The incidence of database than baseline mortality data is not reliable, so the risk of mortality estimates more than estimate uncertainty. This may be incidence is undervalued. The report data uncertainty problems that the air pollution and the risk of death is significant. Therefore, in Ukraine's air pollution cost is quite big, in the near future may be offset by economic growth. A kind of disease morbidity and mortality risk may result in Ukraine on the basis of economic recovery, recovery pollution industry stagnation, because it not only make the economic burden, but also reduce the labor force.
