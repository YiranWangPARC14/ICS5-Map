   <p>Russia has many environmental issues that are very hard to assess because of the size of the country and because of the variable environmental degradation.  Event though Russia is the largest country in the world, its population size is ranked seventh worldwide. Human impact can mostly be seen in the highly populated urban areas; other areas have very little impact. The main environmental issue Russia is greenhouse gas emissions. According to the article “Climate Change and Energy efficiency,” Russia is the third largest carbon dioxide emitter (Charap 127). Russia is a main contributor to global warming and the effects of these contributions are notable on its homeland. I believe this is the most important environmental issue in Russia because these emissions are causing a drastic climate change in Russia. It is said that “Russia will experience global warming to a significantly greater extent than most other countries” (Charap 127). The greenhouse gas emissions are causing a chain reaction among many aspects in the environment because of the climate change, and this why I believe greenhouse gas emissions are the most important environmental issues. Some changes include increased temperature in the last 120 to 150 years of 0.7 degrees Celsius, more floods and forest fires, and melting of permafrost (Charap 127). The melting of permafrost is by far the one with the most impact because of its direct effect of the energy sector, which is crucial in Russia’s economy, water supply and sewer engineering systems (Charap 130).</p>
<p>Russia’s water quality has experienced positive and negative trends in the last thirty years; at some time periods water quality has been good, but at others it has been below sanitary levels. Furthermore, in the article “Environmental Issues in Russia,” it explains that because of the lack of positive trends in the water quality it is necessary for Russia to invest in the treatment of municipal water by heavily investing in the structural side of it (Henry 443). Also, the article explains that some studies show that Russia’s surface water is contaminated with runoff water that wasn’t treated for animal and human waste (Henry 444). Some of the residents in the more affected areas have to boil their water before consuming it in order not to get sick. Also, the number of people arriving to the hospital with parasitic diseases related to contaminated water has been increasing in Southern Russia. Furthermore, besides the municipal water being contaminated by waste some studies have shown that the water has also been industrially contaminated. Scientists have detected heavy metals and radionuclide’s. The industrially polluted or contaminated water has well extended many miles beyond its main source, and some of the water may be considered deadly if consumed.  The main problems with Russia’s water quality are its waste water treatment and industrial proximity; this places water quality after greenhouse gas emissions. If Russia does not invest in the water quality of the nation, then it will become impossible for anyone to live safely. Also, the country as a whole is more prone to deadly diseases contracted via the water system. In an article in the journal of “Environmental Pollution” the author T.I. Moiseenko explains that “a number of human diseases are connected with increased metal concentrations”. The water quality not only affects humans, but also marine populations. Moiseenko explains that a very affected areas is the Kola region surrounded by water and fish, he says “Aquatic environments are final collectors of all kinds of pollution…Life in water bodies…is characterized by a stronger relation between aquatic organisms and factors of the environment due to high mobility of polluting substances in water” (Moiseenko 1).  The water quality comes to affect both humans and marine life. </p>
<p>Russia’s problems with radiation date back to the 1940’s with nuclear weapon testing and accidental radioactive releases  from research facilities, explosive tests, waste storage facilities, and processing plants( Henry 447). The most notable of the accidents has be Chernobyl 1986 where a nuclear power plants exploded creating a ghost town. Russia has had three major power plants,  Chelyabinsk-65, Tomsk- 7, Krasnoyarsk- 76, that have contributed vast amounts of radioactive waste into the surrounding regions. Chelyabinsk-65 housed Russsia’s first nuclear reactors and this is where the production of materials for the first nuclear bomb took place. Furthermore, according to the Journal of “Environmental Science and Technology,” between 1949 and 1952, 2.75 million curies of highly radioactive waste were dumped into the Techa River. As a cause of this 20,000 kilometers of territory are contaminated with radioactive material, making it impossible for anyone to be near the Techa river region. Tomsk- 7 started operating in 1958, but it wasn’t until 1970 when a senior engineer discovered that large quantities of radioactive material had been dumped into a reservoir. However, people did not believe his claims until 1990 and by that time roaming animals and people who had eaten the game had very high levels or radioactive substance into their bodies (603).  Krasnoyarsk- 26  began work in the 1950’s, but it wasn’t until 1990  when an environmental adviser  revealed the results of some studies that reveled high levels of radioactivity in the Yenisei River and along the sediment for hundreds of kilometers downstream. Krasnoyarsk- 26 was fined 6.5 billion rubles for “radiation contamination of the region’s air, soil and water” (603).  The most notable about these events and about these centers of nuclear reactors is that no one knew they were nuclear reactors, only the people that worked in them. Also, the people releasing the radioactive waste did not feel a need to inform the public about the radiation being released into the air.  Russia’s environmental issue with radiation is last because there is nothing much that can be done to try to solve this issue since radioactive waste remains in the atmosphere for many years making it impossible to do anything to dissipate it. </p>
<p>Russia’s green house gas emissions cause a chain reaction causing climate change and in order to reduce green house gas emission Russia must pay attention to technological perspectives and to energy efficiency. Russia can reduce their emissions by changing the infrastructure of their buildings and by adopting renewable energy methods. Russia’s problem with greenhouse gas emissions arises from the fact that there are inefficiencies in their energy system, therefore they are using more energy and exploiting more resources than they should. According to the article “International Technology Transfer for Climate Change Mitigation and the Cases of Russia and China,” in order to address these inefficiencies and reduce their emissions, which contribute to climate change, Russia must renovate and improve the existing infrastructure “[that] play a larger role in greenhouse- gas reductions than do new equipment and construction” (375).  Specific technologies that improve energy efficiency are “(a) meter, valves and automated controls for district- heating supply, distribution, and consumption, especially in the residential sector; (b) reduction of heat leakages and better insulation of buildings and heat distribution pipes in the residential and industrial sectors” (Martinot 375).  In order for these changes to happen Russia must work closely with engineers and with information technology to lessen their global impact. </p>
<p>A promising area for energy is the electric grid that delivers power from large electric power plants. According to the article “Choice of the Unit Power-Generating Capacity of a Nuclear Power Plant,”  “the unified energy system in Russia...consists of a complex of electric power plants and electric grids, combined by a common regime and a unified centralized dispatcher control” (311).  This system extends seven thousand kilometers from east to west and over three thousand kilometers from north to south. Furthermore “high voltage electric transmission lines comprise the basic system-forming grid of the UES and are operated by intersystem’s electric grids”(311). The electric transmission lines are connected through substations, transformers, and measurement-monitoring and measurement- protection devices. It is through the electric transmission lines where the transmission from power plants to users occurs. However, the system must be bigger in order to provide a reliable supply of electricity to the consumers; this is an obstacle that the UES must overcome. The main electric grid performs three functions “delivering power from large electric power plants, supplying electricity to large loads, and supporting the combined operation of energy systems within UES Russia” (312). The regional power plants would benefit from nuclear power plants being drawn into the system because it would reduce the use of natural gas to power the electric power plants, but gas is better than using coal or oil.  </p>
<p>Russia is a very large country and in order to reduce their global impact they must pay attention to their environmental issues that may help them economically in the future. It will be expensive, but the price is worth paying for. Policies must change and all the residue of the Soviet Era must be replaced with better technology in order for change to take place. </p>
