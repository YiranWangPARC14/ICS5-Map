<h1><B>Sweden: The Potential Intersection of Water Pollution and Information Technology</B><BR></h1>
Sweden, with is 9.6 million inhabitants, is the third largest country in Western Europe and is slightly larger than California
in terms of total surface area.  Throughout its territory, the country is a sparsely populated with approximately 23 inhabitants
per square kilometer.  Sweden has been a long proponent of nature conservation and possesses great natural and climatic diversity.
The north region of Sweden is a mountainous area with vast bogs while the south region is a flat farming area.  Sweden's land is
characterized by its biological diversity, lengthy coastline (1,574 kilometers north to south), extensive forests (about half of Sweden)
and many lakes (over 96,000 lakes).  Its abundant aquatic life include fish species such as cod and mackerel (Atlantic Ocean),
salmon and pike (Gulf of Bothnia, lakes, and rivers), and herring (Baltic Sea) (Swedish Institute).  In recent years, however,
the direct results of human activities and behaviors have posed unprecedented threats to the Sweden's ecosystem.  The three most
pressing environmental issues are acid rain damage to soils and lakes, sea level rise, and pollution of the North Sea and the Baltic
Sea, all of which will be briefly described next.<BR><BR>
<h3><B>Sea Level Rise</B></h3>
In recent decades, Sweden has successfully reduced its greenhouse
emissions while still maintaining a thriving economic sector.  However, environmental threats often ignore national boundaries and
such is the case for global warming and sea level rise (Swedish Institute).  Increased global temperatures contribute to sea level rise by thermal expansion and melting of glaciers, ice caps, and ice sheets which flow into the ocean. Sweden is expected to experience a 3-5ºC rise in temperature as a result of climate change by the year 2080. Simultaneously, precipitation will increase, particularly in winter, and the risk of flooding, landslides, and avalanches will escalate as well (Government Offices of Sweden).<BR><BR>
<h3><B>Acid Rain Damage to Soils and Lakes</B></h3>
Acid rain was first identified in 1872 in Sweden.  Acid rain is precipitation in the form of rain, snow, hail, dew, or fog
that transports sulfur and nitrogen compounds from the atmosphere to the ground. According to the Swedish Environmental Protection,
 the acid rain in Sweden is caused by air pollution originally from Britain and other European countries.  Industrial operation,
 fossil fuel production, volcano eruptions, and combustion exhausts release sulfur and nitrogen gases into the atmosphere.
 These elements combine with water in the air to create sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide, which are transferred to soils and
 lakes upon precipitation.  Acid rain primarily affects sensitive bodies of water with limited ability to neutralize acidic pH levels.
 Acid rain has negative effects in the natural environment, in human health, and in man-built structures. Flora and wildlife,
 in particular aquatic life, are unable survive in acidic conditions.  Acidic fog droplets might be inhaled and cause respiratory
 problems in humans and animals.  Metal structures, buildings, and other constructions deteriorate faster upon acidic deposition
 (National Atmospheric Deposition Program).<BR><BR>
<h3><B>Pollution of the North Sea and the Baltic Sea</B></h3>
Pollution of the Baltic Sea represents a major source of concern for Sweden and its neighboring countries in Central Europe.
Water pollutants come from international shipping industry, sewage, industry, waste treatment plants, transportation sector,
and leakage from agriculture.  Some researchers have warned about a potential ecological collapse if stricter measures are not
implemented (Swedish Institute).  As a result, in 2009, the EU member states agreed to participate in a pilot project to save
the Baltic Sea region, which includes international agreements and special government marine environment funding appropriation
to prevent heavy metals, chemicals, household waste and environmental toxins from reaching both the North Sea and Baltic Sea.
These pollutants result in the creation of aquatic “dead zones,” which are pollutant-overloaded zones where limited or no life
can be sustained due to the lack of dissolved oxygen.  Despite the fact that emissions have declined, the Baltic marine environment
has not improved and high levels of pollutants have been consistently found in fatty fish, which renders them unfit for human
consumption according to the standards adopted by the EU (Swedish Institute).<BR><BR>
<h3><B>Information Technology Implications</B></h3>
Among the top three environmental issues faced by Sweden, pollution of its water bodies is the most important concern because it
directly affects marine biological diversity, which represents a major source of food for the Sweden's population and other countries.
The Baltic region situation has worsened over the past 60 years due to human behavior and activities.  Acknowledging that the carrying
capacity of nature is limited, federal regulations and initiatives have been created to aid in protecting and restoring the Swedes
natural environment.  For example, as monitored by the Environmental Objectives Council, 16 national environmental quality
objectives relating to the quality of Sweden's environment are expected to be achieved by the year 2020 (Government Offices of Sweden).
Although water acidification due to sulfur and nitrogen fallout has declined in the past years due to effective international agreements
and environmental efforts, there has been no detectable change in the marine environment.  Water acidification must decrease even
further to reach a level which does not pose a threat to the ecosystem (Government Offices of Sweden).<BR><BR>
Approaching this environmental issue from a technological perspective might help obtain a more in-depth understanding and
inclusive solution to existing and future ecological concerns.  Objectives should be framed in such a way that they are achievable,
which includes considering the fact that nature is slow to recover.  The pollution of the Swedish oceans can be curtailed by harnessing
the potential of information technology, in particular, by stopping marine eutrophication, the loss of biological diversity,
and environmental degradation through the implementation of strict but effective residential and industrial waste reduction
strategies and water treatment and processing technologies to offset the flow of fertilizers, sewage, and industrial pollutants
into rivers and seas.  Additionally, researchers are considering the utilization of wind turbine oxygen pumps (which is known as
the Baltic Deepwater Oxygenation project) and other scientific solutions such as using chloride to chemically bind pollutants
like phosphorus to sediments (Levitt). These efforts to restore the Baltic Sea aquatic ecosystem probably entail field monitoring
sensors, an array of telecommunication systems, and powerful simulation and modeling computer entities such as the ones discussed
in the Habitat Monitoring With Sensor Networks reading.<BR><BR>
Sweden leads the way in the EU in consumption of organic foods, recycling, and renewable energy production.  The official
government page, Sweden.se, stated that for “Swedes today, sustainability is a way of life.” In a survey conducted by
construction firm Veidekke, 7 out of 10 Swedes expressed their willingness to live in eco-labeled housing, even when that
implied paying more for it.  Additionally, the Swede population appears to not only be aware of the potential of integrated
systems solutions and technologies but of their individual, active roles in the process of minimizing unsustainable environmental
degradation and resource over-exploitation (Swedish Institute).  It is therefore, plausible to employ green technology at an
individual scale to address and minimize the collective burden on the environment and its finite resources.  Since the pollution
of the Baltic Sea is transnational in character, the solution should be ideally adopted by all of the contributing parties.
However, the oxygen pumps and chemical binding plans represent only a partial measure to offset the real problem, dumped waste,
which requires not only technological innovations but commitment and accountability as well. <BR><BR>
