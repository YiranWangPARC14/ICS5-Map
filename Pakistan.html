Pakistan is a land of deserts, forests, hills, and plateaus. As the sixth most populated country in the world, Pakistan is also home to three major life-threatening environmental issues: water pollution, air pollution, and deforestation. <br><br>
The arrangement of Pakistan’s top three environmental issues was in order of importance, and this order was arrived at after researching reliable references. The primary resource is direct from the government of Pakistan, in which a “State of the Environment” report was published in 2005. Each key issue of national concern was designated its individual chapter in the report, and this essay models the same order because who better to rank the environmental issues of Pakistan than the Pakistani government officials themselves?<br><br>
Pollution in Pakistan exists in a number of areas: in its water, out in the air, and even found indoors. As one of the central resources to life and the number one environmental problem, clean drinking water in Pakistan can be hard to come by. Its main source of water comes from the Indus basin, which is shared with India, has a history of being polluted (Chapter 1-Water). The only other source is by means of extraction of groundwater; however this method is unreliable. Pakistan’s polluted water is due to an outdated irrigation system, fertilizer contaminations, sewage leakages, and the natural disasters such as the opposing extremes of drought and flood. They can pave the road to dangerous environmental issues such as “reduction of biodiversity, increase in water related diseases, and decrease in agricultural activity…socio-economic repercussions” (Chapter 1-Water). The issue of clean water does not stop at the scarcity of it; it was not until recently that the Pakistan people were able to transport the water. Dr. Samia Altaf’s 2008 essay on the Pakistan water crisis demonstrated the politics behind its challenges. Though the Pakistan government had been well-aware of the health issues, economic and social costs of their polluted water, the advanced technology that could fix it, there was a social class issue that existed, getting in the way of the lower class speaking out; they didn’t have a voice in higher government (Altaf). <br><br>
Air pollution is directly correlated with Pakistan’s ever-increasing urbanization and industrialization and is the country’s second most important environmental issue. With more and more people populating the country, the demand for living space and resources will only further damage the air quality of Pakistan. From industrialized cities such as Lahore and Karachi come factories of cement, iron steel, and fertilizer, and power plants for petrochemical activity (Chapter 2-Air Quality). In addition, exhaust from vehicles, emitted gas from burning waste and running factories have pushed Pakistan’s “safe limits” in air safety. Although the anthropogenically-emitted particles are a direct product from the unfortunate combination of both urbanization and industrialization, the polluted air is also caused by the weather conditions. Pakistan has an annually declining amount of rainfall, with as low as 80 mm of rain in South Pakistan. In combination with the low wind circumstances, the pollution has nowhere to go. Pollution is even found indoors, where a percentage of animal feces are burnt for fuel. The gases in rural areas from this activity make it almost inescapable for the Pakistan people to breathe in polluted air (PCAP). At the root, a growing population can be blamed for these issues, but the issue of overpopulation is worldwide, and too widespread to take on.<br><br>
The third environment issue of Pakistan is deforestation and its crisis of the declining availability of natural forests. Pakistan forest trees are being cut down for their demand industrially and for everyday uses such as grazing, watershed regulation and fuel wood consumption (Chapter 3- Forests). With a diminishing supply and escalating demand, prices for precious lumber will only go up; this is the law of supply and demand. This is profitable for the plantations that produce timber, but the future for those local forests doesn’t look very promising. This will lead to the importing of foreign wood, implementing pressure for forest management to “fill the supply gap” (Chapter 3- Forests). Pakistan’s forest degradation is associated with other issues of desertification, decreasing tourism, global warming, and biodiversity conservation.<br><br>
An Information Technology that can be used in association with two of these environmental issues—air and water pollution—is a continuous monitoring facility that tracks the quality of the air and water in order to assess the data to the Pakistan public (PCAP).  This form of IT is similar to the data-delivering habitat monitoring nodes from one of our class readings, “Habitat Monitoring with Sensor Networks”. The authors of the article stressed the value of a constant, uninterrupted observation of the chosen organism’s environment, not just a few random extrapolations from the site (Habitat Monitoring). The same goes for examining the country’s air and water. With the variables of time of day, temperature, air pressure, and other uncontrollable factors, it is not representative to only track the pollution in intervals; the process must be done in a continuous fashion. <br><br>
The data from the monitoring systems can be categorized by source of pollution, for example the particulate matter from vehicle and engine exhaust. This way the Pakistani people will be conscious of their contribution to the pollution as an individual and be more mindful of the damage. The data would shed light on prevention of diseases and harmful substances. In addition, the data should be available to any Pakistani, at any time, as up-to-date as possible. Awareness is key to solving environmental issues, and with the help of IT such as smart phone apps and the Internet, more citizens will be in the know. <br><br>
Because air and water pollution directly affects human, animal, and plant life (and in some cases, the quality of ecosystems, buildings, and even artwork), it is of upmost importance that Pakistan continues to implement this IT, in every part of the country. There should be one in every city, running 24/7. The nodes described in “Habitat Monitoring with Sensor Networks” were powered by batteries, but the government of Pakistan should consider investing in a more efficient system of energy. Pakistan’s Clean Air Program (PCAP) was part of its Five Year Plan of 2005-2010, in which funds were set aside specifically for improving the air quality. Nodes can already track “sunlight, humidity, air pressure, and temperature” (Habitat Monitoring); the next step now is to monitor the water supply for possible waterborne diseases such as typhoid, hepatitis, cholera, and dysentery, because 33% of deaths in Pakistan hospitals are due to water contamination (Chapter 1-Water). Air and water are two precious substances essential to every human life, breathed in and swallowed into our bodies; too precious to be polluted.<br><br>
