ISRAEL
<p>
        Israel as a country has been faced with environmental issues of population size, water supply and consumption, and air pollution.  “Issues associated with rapid development, consecutive wars, and civil unrest has caused Israel to overuse its limited resources and travel down a road of environmental destruction (Nadav 2010).” Israel is a small country with limited resources, but Israel's capacity for research and development does not have the ability to move away from the consumption of finite resources to the use of more sustainable technology (Nadav 2010). Israel is a leader in the development of green technology, but it is currently being exported to other countries around the world (Nadav 2010). 
Population size, water consumption, and air quality, I believe are the most important and most pressing issues in need of change.  Population affects both water supply and consumption and air quality.  Air quality is the easiest of the three to fix.  These three issues are critical to the preservation of Israel's environment and its citizen's health. </p>
<p>
	Israel's increased population has been one of the biggest causes of environmental pollution. With an increase in population comes an increase in consumption. As a result, resources have become increasingly scarce. Israel's policy of Zionism has been used to encourage population growth (Orenstein 2004). Before 1948, most of Israel was empty and desolate. Over the past half-century this has changed.  “Israel is ranked third in most densely populated regions in the Middle East following Bahrein and Lebanon (Goldewijk 2005).” Before 1948, Palestine had a population of approximately 1,000,000 people. After Israel's War of Independence, it was predicted that Israel's population would grow at the rate of 1 million people per decade (Tai 2008).  “After the 1989 fall of Soviet Russia, 1000 Russian Jews per day arrived in Israel, adding 20% to Israel's population, making them the largest ethnic group in Israel (Tai 2008).”  Israel's increasing population has had a huge environmental impact on its finite resources. </p>
<p>        
	Another major issue is Israel's limited water resources.  The rise in population size has caused a huge strain on available water resources.  The Jordan River has been reduced significantly and other rivers have dried up or have become contaminated by its industrial sector.  The issue of low rainfall and persistent droughts has added to the strain of Israel's water resources.  The Kinneret is Israel's only freshwater lake and it consistently drops below its minimum integrity level (Nadav 2010).  Most of Israel's drinking water comes from aquifers making up 20% of its overall water supply (Tal 2006).  A finite water supply faced with an overall increasing population has huge environmental implications. </p>
<p>
 	With the rise of industry, as a result of an increasing population, Israel's air quality has become a serious issue that carries the label of the “invisible killer (Nadav 2010).” Air quality is one of Israel's most serious problems and yet it has one of the easiest solutions. Government standards for emissions are an important aspect of any clean air initiative.  The issue is not with Israel's standards, but its enforcement of those standards.  “In many cities pollutant levels are approximately 65% above the levels set by the World Health Organization (WHO) (Nadav 2010).”  Most air pollution is created by transportation, energy production, and industry. Over the past few years there has been an increase in all three (Nadav 2010).  “The majority of air pollutants are particle matter, nitrous oxide, ozone, hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, carbon dioxide and lead (Nadav 2010).” Air pollution is amplified by Israel's small, arid climate, lack of rain, and coastal industries near dense populations. </p> 
<p>
	The use of information technology (IT) has a critical role in the development of sustainable technology.  After researching the issues that Israel faces regarding population size, water consumption, and air pollution, it is critical to emphasize the importance of developing policies and conducting research with the goal of achieving sustainable technology.  One third of the Earth's resource base has been used in just the past decade (Leonard 2008).  It is without question, that we are wasting valuable and finite resources.  “We cannot continue run on a linear system of production and consumption on a finite planet (Story of Stuff).”  The development of sustainable technology is key and critical in moving away from a “cradle-to-grave” policy to a “cradle-to-cradle” policy (McDonough 2008).  </p>
<p>
	In looking at our first issue, population size has a direct influence on water supply and air pollution among other things.  As a population increases, a society is faced with issues of production, consumption, and waste.  Being the population plays such a critical role in all other environmental issues, it is important to monitor and to regulate the country's population. In the case of Israel, its population has increased exponentially over the years.  As a result of this increase, Israel has been faced with the issue of trying to accommodate a large population within a finite space.  If Israel's policies and enforcement of those policies do not change, it will more than likely lead to future wars and conflicts adding to already complicated environmental issues. </p>
<p>
	Water is critical to life on this planet and there only exists a limited supply.  In Israel's case, as its population increases, so does its consumption of water.  It does not help that Israel was located in the middle of the desert with very few water resources to choose from.  In this case, IT has played a key and critical role in the development of sustainable technology that will forever change the world, as we know it.  Here Israel has made incredible headway.  It has introduced the world to new desalinization technologies in which it can take ocean water, remove the salt, and turn it into a viable alternative for fresh drinking water.  </p>
<p>
	As Israel's population increased, so did its capacity for production. Industrialization in Israel has changed the landscape immensely since its inception in 1948.  In today's world, industrialization has played a critical part in any country's development.  It has also led to an increase in overall air pollution.  Being faced with an increasing population and a decreasing living space, air pollution has had an adverse impact on the overall health and the well being of Israeli citizens.  Air pollution is an issue that affects everyone. In order to solve its air quality issues, all Israel would need to do is simply cease its current levels of production.  Being that Israel feels threatened by other countries within its region, it cannot justify taking such action. Air pollution in Israel is a train that is traveling at a high velocity. This train can stop, but the likelihood for change has yet to be seen. </p>
<p>
	Information technology exists and it has the potential to change every aspect of our lives.  Through the use of IT, we have seen huge improvements in our understanding of environmental issues.  Israel is at a critical place where has to make hard choices.  Granted IT has so much potential and room for improvement, but it is up to us to choose what it is that we do with it.  It is one thing to understand a problem, but it is a whole other issue to mobilize and take action against environmental issues that threaten our very existence.</p>
