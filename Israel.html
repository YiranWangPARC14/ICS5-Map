ISRAEL
<p>
        Israel as a country has been faced with environmental issues of population size, water supply and air pollution. Israel has been faced issues associated with rapid development, consecutive wars, and civil unrest which have lead to excessive use scarce resources and full scale environmental destruction (Nadav 2010).  While many are concerned about the threat to Israel, many overlook the real threat to the health of Israelis by environmental hazards. Israel is a small country with limited finite resources but enormous scientific, engineering, and academic resources (Nadav 2010).  Israel is already a world leader in the new field of clean technology, but it is being exported to other countries (Nadav 2010). Israel is has the potential to change its current trajectory and to be an influential example for other states to follow.  Population size, water supply, and air quality, I believe are the most important and most pressing issues in need of reevaluation and policy implementation in order to preserve finite resources until we improve sustainable technologies.</p>
<p>
	Population density is one of the most influential causes of environmental pollution.  Almost every aspect of life is influenced by a population's consumption of resources and environmental pollution.  As a population increases consumption increases, resources become scarcer, and pollution tends to increase.  Encouraging population growth, specifically Jewish population growth, has been central to the predominant ideological and religious beliefs in the Jewish sector of Israel, also known as Zionism (Orenstein 2004). </p>
<p>        
	Before the 1948 creation of Israel as a state, most of the land area in the region was empty and desolate.  Over the past 60 years this has changed.  Israel has transformed into one of the most densely populated countries on earth.  Israel is ranked third in most densely populated regions in the Middle East following Bahrein and Lebanon.  Israel's population density is 300 inhabitants per kilometer squared (Goldewijk 2005).  </p>
<p>
 	Prior to the Israel becoming a state, Palestine's permanent population was around one million people.  The massive influx of Jewish refugees following the War of Independence did little to change the overall population density, given the simultaneous exodus of Palestinian refugees.  It was projected in the Sharon Plan that Israel's population would increase at the rate of one million people per decade (Tai 2008).  By 1951, Israel's population had already increased by 100% (Tai 2008). After the 1989 fall of Soviet Russia, 1000 Russian Jews per day arrived in Israel, adding 20% to Israel's population, making them the largest ethnic group in Israel (Tai 2008).  Israel's increasing population has huge environmental implications because it reduces the resources available and necessary for sustaining a population such as water and air. </p> 
<p>
	Israel's most pressing environmental changes involving water has also been the area where it has made the most progress (Nadav 2010).  Israel's desolate land provides very few natural water resources, and the explosion of industry and population has caused a huge strain on already scarce water resources.  The Jordan River as a water source has been reduced significantly.  Other rivers throughout Israel have either dried up or have been contaminated by industrial discharge, sewage and agricultural pollutants like pesticides and fertilizers (Nadav 2010).  </p>
<p>
	As a result of years of low rainfall, Israel has been faced with persistent draughts. The Kinneret, also known as the Sea of Galilee, Israel's only fresh water lake, constantly falls below the minimum level needed to maintain its integrity without turning into a swamp (Nadav 2010).  Lake Kinneret holds roughly one-third of all of Israel's replenishable water supply (Tal 2006).  The Dead Sea is reaching record lows and is at risk of drying up completely (Nadav 2010).  Most of its drinking water comes from aquifers which are quickly being drained or polluted (Nadav 2010).  These aquifers provide an additional 20% to the overall water supply (Tal 2006).  Demand and consumption has steadily increased as supplies become scarcer.  Annual water availability is less than 250 meters cubed per person (250,000 liters) (Tal 2006).  The internationally recognized Falkenmark indicator sets 1000 meters cubed per person as a minimum annual level below which countries experience water stress.  Israel's supplies are at 50% of the annual per capita “absolute scarcity” level of 500 meters cubed (Tal 2006) </p>
<p>
	Israel's response to improving water economy in numerous ways has been increased uses of desalinization, water saving technologies, extensive use of recycled water, purification systems for aquifers and fresh water systems and the institution of and enforcement of stricter regulations. Israel's developing technologies have been groundbreaking in both innovation and application.  Oceans cover over 70% of the world's surface and constitute 97% of the world's water.  Of the 3% of the world's fresh water, an estimated 70% is contained in the polar ice caps and is not available for human consumption.  This leaves the world with only a remaining 1% of useable drinking water (Nadav 2010).  Until recently, fresh water has been considered to be a finite resource, but Israel is proving that this is not the case.  Israel has developed and implemented desalinization, which extracts fresh water from ocean water.  This is a major innovation, but has yet to reach a level of sustainability.  </p>
<p>
	Air quality is one of Israel's most immediate health concerns and is often called the “invisible killer” (Nadav 2010).  It is both one of the most serious, but also one of the easiest problems to solve.  Air flows from one region to the next, and there is no need to clean the air, rather simply stop polluting it and the air will clean itself.  Emission standards, which are set and enforced by the government, are the most important aspect of any clean air initiative.  Israel's standards are good, but they are poorly enforced.  In many cities pollutant levels are approximately 65% above the levels set by the World Health Organization (WHO) (Nadav 2010).  </p>
<p>
	A national network measures Israel's air quality with over 2000 stations throughout the country.  There are various problems that are region specific.  Most air pollution is created by transportation, energy production and industry, and these have all increased dramatically over the past few years (Nadav 2010).  The number of vehicles has almost doubled within the last ten years (Nadav 2010).  The majority of air pollutants are particle matter, nitrous oxide, ozone, hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, carbon dioxide and lead (Nadav 2010). </p>
<p>
	Air pollution in Israel is worsened by its landscape.  The small, arid climate, lack of rain, and coastal industries near densely populated areas adds to the increasingly poor air quality.  An example of this is Haifa Bay.  It combines intensive industry activity with difficult atmospheric conditions caused by the Mediterranean Sea and the landscape of Mount Carmel. This has lead to a high level of pollutants, which are not easily dispersed.  Despite the years of effort to reduce air pollution, these measures have been mostly unsuccessful (Nadav 2010).  </p>
<p>
	Until we develop sustainable technologies, as the population in Israel increases resources will become increasingly scarce.  Israel's policy of Zionism needs to be reevaluated before its population size reaches a point where resources cease to exist (e.g. water) and other resources become uninhabitable (e.g. air).  Israel's water levels are a 50% of the annual per capita “absolute scarcity” level of 500 meters cubed, which is set by the WHO.  Most air pollution in Israel is created by transportation, energy production and industry, which all have increased dramatically over the past few years.  Simply, resources are finite and are necessary for Israel's survival as a nation.  Population size, water supply, and air quality, I believe are the most important and most pressing issues in need of reevaluation and policy implementation in order to protect future generations.  </p>
